      "description": "Accident and Emergency Statistics. The A&E datamart was established in June 2007 to monitor the compliance of each NHS Board against the 4 hour wait standard. In July 2010 the A&E data mart was extended further to collect items such as diagnosis, several injury fields and an alcohol involved flag, which will be used to identify whether the patient\u2019s alcohol consumption was a factor in the attendance. The collection of the new fields has been driven by a variety of SG policy decisions and interest from a number of organisations. Although there is now the facility to submit these additional fields, they are still under development and ISD are working with the NHS Boards to support data collection and quality. There are two types of data submitted to the A&E datamart: episode and aggregate level data. All hospitals with Emergency Departments submit episode level data containing a detailed record for each patient attendance. Some smaller sites with minor injury units or community hospitals only submit aggregate files containing monthly summary attendance and compliance figures only. This is because they do not have the information systems and support to enable collection of detailed patient based information. Sites that submit episode level data account for around 94% of all attendances at A&E.",

      "description": "https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.201905-1017OC \n\nIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by the build-up of scar tissue in the lungs. It is believed that the damage to the alveolar epithelium is followed by an aberrant wound healing response leading to the deposition of dense fibrotic tissue, reducing the lungs\u2019 flexibility and inhibiting gas transfer. IPF still has limited therapeutic interventions and a high mortality rate within 3-5 years from diagnosis. To date, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of IPF susceptibility have associated common variants (minor allele frequency [MAF]>5%) near genes involved in host defence, telomere maintenance, cell-cell adhesion and signalling in disease susceptibility. \nMeta-analysis of GWAS of IPF susceptibility. Building up on published GWAS results (PMID: 24429156, 23583980, 29066090) and novel study samples, we have performed the largest GWAS of IPF susceptibility to date to identify novel genes and further advance in the understanding of IPF pathogenesis and risk (bioRxiv https://doi.org/10.1101/636761 and PMID:31710517). The discovery stage of the study comprised up to 2,668 IPF cases and 8,591 controls from 3 studies (Chicago study: 541 IPF cases and 542 controls, Colorado study: 1515 fibrotic Idiopathic Interstitial pneumonia cases and 4683 controls, UK Study: 612 IPF cases and 3366 controls)  and replication was pursued in an additional 1,456 IPF cases and 11,874 controls. The genome-wide association study summary statistics from the meta-analysis of three studies totalling  2,668 cases and 8,591 controls are available here.",

Before normal discharge can occur two conditions must be satisfied, a clinician must assess the patient as suitable for discharge and somebody has to arrange an appropriate destination. From this point onwards, the patient is awaiting discharge, usually awaiting confirmation that the bed is available. The simplest way to monitor this aspect of critical care is to allow the \u2018discharge period\u2019 to be derived from the raw data and to allow users to analyse the information against whichever local or national criteria prevail at the time. In order to capture the raw data a point in time has to be identified as the start of the discharge period.\nThe discharge period begins when the following conditions have been met:\n- The patient has been declared clinically ready for discharge or transfer.\n- AND a formal request has been made to the hospital bed management system, (or\nappropriate staff with authority to admit at the intended destination).\n- AND the date and time of this status is recorded as such in the clinical record. (It may facilitate data collection if there is a recognised place for recording the request date and time either in the patient\u2019s notes or within the data collection system for the CCMDS). Note that discharge planning may occur in advance of and in the expectation that a patient will become fit for discharge at a certain time in the future. For the purposes of these data, the start time will remain the point at which both conditions are fully satisfied. If a discharge is deemed a premature discharge this field should not be filled in. Thus, the discharge period is the number of hours between the start of the period and the actual time of departure from the unit as recorded elsewhere in the dataset.",

      "description": "Bariatric surgery produces substantial, long-term weight loss with reduced morbidity and mortality. Genetics can strongly influence this response, as well as the initial propensity to obesity. Several genes have been implicated but more in-depth mechanistic studies are needed to understand how genes affect energy regulation and mediate the beneficial effects of bariatric surgery.\nThe Obesity Research Biobank Syndicate (ORBiS) aims to fulfil this need. It provides a comprehensive collection of high-quality biological samples and patient data to facilitate mechanistic research and help translate it to improved treatments for patients. \nPatients undergoing bariatric surgery are recruited from multiple centres in the UK. With informed consent, blood or saliva samples are collected pre-operatively and tissue collected during surgery. Samples include: adipose tissue (subcutaneous and visceral), muscle, liver, stomach and small intestine. Relevant clinical and demographic data are linked and stored pseudo anonymised in a secure database. Tissue collections are transported to and processed in the ORBiS laboratory at University College London, and stored at UCL-Royal Free Hospital Biobank for future use.\nResearch programmes will be supported within and beyond the contributing sites. External researchers will be required to obtain individual REC approval prior to submitting an application.",

The English Indices of Deprivation provide a relative measure of deprivation at small area level across England. Areas are ranked from least deprived to most deprived on seven different dimensions of deprivation and an overall composite measure of multiple deprivation. The domains used in the Indices of Deprivation are: income deprivation; employment deprivation; health deprivation and disability; education deprivation; crime deprivation; barriers to housing and services deprivation; and living environment deprivation. Each of these domains has its own scores and ranks, allowing users to focus on specific aspects of deprivation. In addition, two supplementary indices measure income deprivation amongst children - the Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index (IDACI) - and older people - the Income Deprivation Affecting Older People Index (IDAOPI).\n\n\n\nThe current HES version of the Index is 2010, although the current IMD version of the index is 2015 which can be found on the IMD website:\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2015\n\n\n\nThis field uses IMD version 2004 on activity up to and including 2006-07; IMD version 2007 on activity between 2007-08 and 2009-10; IMD version 2010 on activity from 2010-11 to present.",

Risk stratification is based on BM immunophenotyping and SFLC ratio. All patients will receive standard local radiotherapy; this is not regarded as trial treatment and may be administered prior to study entry.\n- Patients with high-risk features will be randomised to receive adjuvant therapy in the form of lenalidomide and dexamethasone or no further treatment.\n- Patients without high-risk features will receive no further therapy and will be observed according to local practice.\n140 patients:\n- 98 patients with high risk features to be randomised at a 1:1 ratio\n- 42 low risk patients for registration only",

It provides the functionality to record all of a baby's neonatal care in Scotland, from antenatal through to post delivery, including readmissions and transfers in one electronic record. SBR is based on individuals and events rather than episodes and is completed for all births including stillbirths and home births. The system has been implemented to varying degrees (either directly or indirectly via interfaces with existing hospital systems) in all Scottish hospitals providing midwifery and/or neonatal care. A CHI number is generated soon after a baby is born in order to minimise the chances of a baby being lost on the database through a change of name after birth. The SBR collects a wide variety of information on the child from birth and during the baby's first year of life, with up to four hundred data items recorded for any one individual. This includes gestation, weight, congenital anomalies and discharge details. Identifiers such as name, date of birth, Community Health Index number and postcode are also included.",

      "description": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0321-7       \nLung function is an important indicator of respiratory health and mortality. Measures of lung function show irreversible airway obstruction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a progressive condition affecting 900,000 people in the UK. Smoking is a strong risk factor for COPD but not all smokers are equally susceptible. Genetic approaches to understanding the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of good lungs aim to reveal previously unknown molecular targets for drug development and to facilitate stratified approaches to treatment and care. This project aims to detect rare genetic variants associated with lung function. Once discovered, such variants tend to exert a large effect on disease risk and provide a means to translate findings from genetic studies of lung function to clinical relevant research and development. The proposed study leverages the power of Uk Biobank and respiratory genomics to advance understanding of lung function and COPD.",

Test results are electronically transferred from secondary care systems.\n\nThere are no standard rules for recording data within primary care clinical information systems. Therefore, each individual clinician can record information in their own way. The majority use Read Code Terminology, however, sometimes this is applied behind the scenes by the clinical system and sometimes local codes are used. Read codes are not as precise as ICD 10 or OPCS codes.\n\nCoding standards have been agreed on for conditions monitored by the QOF (Quality Outcomes Framework) returns.

      "description": "The HBRC is an HTA-licensed biorepository dedicated to the collection of appropriately consented high quality human biomaterials, their processing, storage and distribution to biomedical researchers. The HBRC resides within the purpose-built Advanced Therapies Facility (ATF) within the College of Medical and Dental Sciences (CMDS) at the University of Birmingham (UoB). The ATF also houses both cell and gene therapy manufacturing units.\nSamples are collected, processed and stored (or released) from patients in a variety of disease settings in response to local demand and research strategies in order to facilitate existing research and enable future research areas to be developed. Samples may comprise adult or paediatric tissue which is waste, or surplus to diagnosis taken at the time of surgery or treatment, additional samples taken specifically for research purposes, material taken from patients enrolled in clinical trials, and control material. The HBRC works with local researchers and carries out bespoke tissue collections. All samples can be annotated with the appropriate clinical data which makes them scientifically useful. \nAlthough the HBRC is primarily a resource for local researchers within CMDS and local NHS Trusts, applications from other UK research groups and the commercial sector are also considered. The policy and procedures associated with the review of these applications, and the subsequent release of samples and associated data, are the same for both internal and external applicants. All samples and associated data are released for research in a fully anonymised form, and a Tissue Transfer Agreement ensures that they will only be used for the purposes approved at release and will not be transferred without written permission. In order to enhance the value of the HBRC collection, every attempt is made to secure the return of useful research data following the completion of research studies.",

The survey measured the overall quality of life of representative samples of cancer survivors with breast, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL) diagnosed during July 2006 - July 2010. Quality of life was assessed at four different time points after diagnosis at approximately one, two, three or five years. As this was a pilot survey, numbers are small and data governance issues will need to be carefully considered on a study by study basis. Outcome items in the survey are made up of Euroqol 5-level (EQ-5D), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT), and Social Difficulties Inventory (SDI) items.",

      "description": "The NIHR Bioresource consists of several groups of participants: ~70k from the general population and blood donors (COMPARE, INTERVAL and STRIDES studies); ~19k with one of ~50 rare diseases (RD) including a ~5k pilot for GEL; ~30k with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) which include the members of the HDR UK IBD Hub; and ~20k with Anxiety or depression (GLAD study). It intends to extend recruitment in all areas, and to other rare and common disease groups, with a target of ~300k by 2022. The NIHR BioResource acquires contact details - name, address, email address, phone/mobile number - from participants at recruitment.  This is used to recontact participants to invite them to take part in experimental medicine studies, although sample-only and data-only studies are permitted.  We also record NHS number, where known, to allow linkage to healthcare records. Recruitment takes place at blood donor centres, disease clinics, online (particularly for the Mental Health BioResource) but also from more public settings. A participant is not considered a member of the NIHR BioResource without contact details. NHS number availability depends on recruitment method: blood donors and those recruited through clinics will have these to hand, general members of the public will not.",

      "description": "GOSH is the custodian of the most recent study dataset (\u201cIMPORT\u201d - 650 patients, 2012-2019). All of the trial/study datasets include: Full patient and tumour\ndemographics, including associated congenital abnormalities, tumour stage, treatment received (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy) with individual drug names and doses and additional pathological details on histological subtype (risk group), follow up for relapse and death. In addition, the most recent study \u2013 \u201cIMPORT\u201d (Improving Population Outcomes for Renal Tumours of childhood) contains data on the presenting symptoms that led to diagnosis of kidney cancer,\nan imaging archive of CT and MRI scans sent for central radiology review and biological samples (frozen tumour, blood, normal kidney) stored centrally on ~two\nthirds of cases. There is also tumour genomic copy number data available on about one third of the prior trial \u2013 SIOP WT 2001 (that ran in the UK, 2002-2011).\n\nChildhood renal tumour dataset\n\nThis document describes the research dataset constructed through the Improving Population Outcomes for Renal Tumours of childhood (IMPORT) study from 2012 \u2013 2019 (https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/find-a-clinical-trial/study-improving-treatment-children-kidney-cancer. The aim of this prospective clinical observational study is to achieve continuous improvement in short and long term outcomes for children with Wilms tumour and other rarer types of childhood renal tumours. The study collects clinical, molecular and imaging data to underpin the introduction of a more personalised approach to risk stratification \u2013 the process by which each child is assigned to one of several \u2018standard of care\u2019 treatment arms according to the predicted risk of their tumour recurring. \n\nIt is a live database, currently comprising data on 670 children with kidney tumours who are resident across the UK and Republic of Ireland. This represents >90% of all incident cases diagnosed in the population. Clinical data and patient samples are collected with explicit consent of their parent/guardian for use in research and for sharing with the relevant national cancer registration service according to where the child is resident at diagnosis.\n\nData are collected throughout the patient journey and are presented in tables with each data item as a comma separated value (CSV) corresponding to a data field captured through a case report form (CRF). These span the following timepoints from presentation to completion of treatment and then annual follow up or reporting of any events (relapse/death/second tumour). \n\nF1 Registration information\nF2 Pre-operative chemotherapy (Unilateral tumours only)\nF3 Surgical form \u2013 operative findings\nF4 Pathology form \u2013 institutional pathologist\nF6 Post-operative chemotherapy\nF11 Cardiotoxicity reporting form\nF12 Bilateral Wilms tumour form \u2013 additional registration information (12a) and response assessment (12b)\nF15 Reference Pathology \u2013 \u201cCentral review\u201d\nF17 Treatment of relapse or progression\nF18 Follow up form \u2013 for annual follow up reporting and to report any relapse or death.\nF20A End of treatment summary (Unilateral tumours)\nF20B End of treatment summary (Bilateral tumours)\n\nDetails of the content of each CRF are in the table below.\n\nMost children (~90%) with Wilms tumour survive their cancer. Hence, an important aspect of the dataset is the planned linkage of each child\u2019s data to their national cancer registration record. This will permit measurement of very long term health outcomes in adulthood by linkage to routine health care data utilising the approved information governance systems through which the UK\u2019s national cancer registration services work with the NHS to ensure patient confidentiality. \n\nThe IMPORT study is one of five sequential clinical trials and studies that registered the majority of children diagnosed with kidney cancer in the UK and Republic of Ireland between 1980-2019 (over 3,000 patients). It is intended that these additional four closed trial datasets will be made available in the same way during 2020.\n\nThese trials\u2019 primary endpoints, of relapse-free and overall survival according to clinically defined risk groups, have been published, with full clinical quality assurance completed. Over that 39 year period, risk stratification and treatment schedules have been refined many times, to reduce exposure to therapies that may cause long term side effects such as heart damage or second tumours. These adverse \u2018late effects\u2019 may take decades before they are first seen. Hence, these linked datasets are an important proof of principle about how very long term outcomes can be studied through linkage of clinical trials to routine health care data sources.  \n\nThe IMPORT dataset will continue to be enlarged and enriched with tumour molecular information (copy number, genomic sequencing) and imaging review data (CT/MRI scans). These data items are not available for the previous closed trials.\n\n\nOptional material if needed:\n\nPlans for the linked dataset with the national cancer registration and analysis service (NCRAS) of Public Health England. \n\nThis project will create a new permanent data linkage between each patient\u2019s trial identifier and data and their existing national cancer registration record, with all personally identifiable data being handled within the existing nationally approved information governance and data protection frameworks of the clinical trial units and the cancer registration service of each nation. The following technical description applies to Public Health England\u2019s National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS). Access to the linked community prescription data is made available through PHE\u2019s Office for Data Release.\n\nNCRAS routinely collects and quality assures clinical information on all cases of cancer that occur in people living in England to construct a cancer registration record.  The data collected by NCRAS comes from several sources including Multi-Disciplinary Team meetings and pathology reports. The patient identifiers collected facilitate linkage to other routinely collected datasets, that include Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) with details of all admissions, A&E attendances and outpatient appointments at NHS hospitals in England, mortality data, the Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy and Radiotherapy datasets from all hospital providers and community dispensed prescriptions data. \n\nPatient-level linkage to inpatient HES is routinely processed by NCRAS. PHE receives pseudonymised dispensed prescriptions data from NHS Business Services Authority, allowing patient-level linkage to the National Cancer Registration Dataset without revealing the identities of those without cancer.  Prescription data is available from April 2015 to February 2019, providing a 3-4 year window of prescription drug usage by survivors of childhood renal tumours. \n\nThe project\u2019s primary aim is addressed by calculating cumulative and relative risks of hospitalisation for specific organ dysfunctions from the HES-linked data set and relative risks of prescriptions for specific drugs compared to the general population rates. This newly created linked dataset can be refreshed for future follow up studies and linkage to additional datasets that may become available such as patient-reported outcome measures.\n\nFor HES-based analyses, follow-up will start at whichever is the later of 1 April 1997 and date of renal tumour diagnosis.  For community prescriptions analyses, follow-up will start at whichever is the later of 1 April 2015 and date of renal tumour diagnosis.  For both sets of analyses, follow-up will end at whichever is earliest of death, emigration, latest date for which linked death certificate data are complete, and the latest date for which data are complete in the linked databases for HES or community prescriptions as applicable.\n\nCumulative risk of hospitalisation for specific organ dysfunctions will be estimated from the HES-linked data set with death treated as a competing risk.  Relative risk of hospitalisation for specific organ dysfunctions will be estimated by dividing the observed number in the HES-linked data set by the expected number obtained by multiplying the number of person-years accumulated in each age-sex-calendar year stratum in the study cohort by the general population rate in the corresponding stratum calculated from the entire HES database.  Relative risks of prescriptions for specific drugs will be estimated in a similar way using the linked community prescription data set and the entire community prescription database.",

The study comprises two separate cohorts, a Birth Cohort and a 5-year-old Cohort.  The birth cohort is further split into two sub-groups, postnatal and antenatal, allocation to these groups is determined by the time of recruitment.  Recruitment to the two cohorts is currently ongoing across the UK.  A large amount of phenotypic and environmental exposure data is being collected via questionnaires and record linkage. A data dictionary, available on the study website, contains details of all the available data.  \nAs a minimum, biological mother and affected child are recruited to the study.  Where possible, biological father or mother's partner is also recruited.  In addition, the study aims to recruit unaffected and affected siblings for a small proportion of the cohort.  \nBiological samples are collected from all participants.  Parents and siblings of both cohorts and affected children of the 5-year-old cohort provide saliva samples.  Residual tissue and blood samples are collected from affected children recruited to the birth cohort.  In addition, cord blood samples are collected from families recruited to the antenatal strand.",

      "description": "The Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework (ASCOF) measures how well care and support services achieve the outcomes that matter most to people. The measures are grouped into four domains which are typically reviewed in terms of movement over time. These domains are:\n\nenhancing quality of life for people with care and support needs\ndelaying and reducing the need for care and support\nensuring that people have a positive experience of care and support\nsafeguarding adults whose circumstances make them vulnerable and protecting from avoidable harm\nThe ASCOF aims to give an indication of the strengths and weaknesses of social care in delivering better outcomes for people who use services. This report will be of interest to:\n\ncentral government - for policy development and monitoring, and for parliamentary questions and Prime Minister's Questions\nCouncils with Adult Social Services Responsibilities (CASSRs) - for measuring local performance and for benchmarking against other CASSRs\ncharities\nacademics\nthe general public.",

SIRS calls children when a scheduled vaccination is due and allows recording of immunisation data. The dataset also includes data on HPV (Human papillomavirus) and the teenage booster immunisations and is used conjunction with the data on the Child Health Surveillance Programme School system (CHSP School) to monitor the uptake of teenage immunisations routinely given in schools.",

Recruitment has taken place in Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland since 2013 and is ongoing, with >10,000 participants aged 30-69 to date. The population of Leicester is diverse and additional recruitment from the local South Asian community is ongoing. Participants provided a DNA sample, have consented to follow-up for up to 25 years through electronic health records and additional bespoke data collection is planned. Data available includes baseline demographics, anthropometry, spirometry, lifestyle factors (smoking and alcohol use) and longitudinal health information from primary care records, with additional linkage to other EHR datasets planned. Patients have consented to be contacted for recall-by-genotype and recall-by-phenotype sub-studies. Genome-wide genotype data are available via EGA for 5218 individuals.",

The primary endpoint, determined by RECIST v1.1, is clinical benefit (objective response + stable disease rate) measured after four cycles of vinflunine chemotherapy. Secondary endpoints are objective response rate (CR+PR), toxicity, progression-free survival, overall survival and treatment compliance. Formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumour blocks are held at the Orchid Tissue Laboratory and Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry.",

Codes are updated in line with that but codes/hierarchies that no longer appear in the published BNF are retained in the BNF classification that we use.  In addition, the hierarchy is built into the code and so, where there are a large number of drugs and preparations within a particular area of the hierarchy, there can be too many to be coded into that hierarchy.  In these cases, additional codes and hierarchies not actually present in the published BNF can be created. Items found in the appendices of the BNF (e.g. nutritional supplements) will usually appear in additional chapters created in the BNF hierarchy.",

      "description": "Many people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remain very breathless and limited. In some patients, with the appropriate pattern of emphysema, an operation called lung volume reduction surgery is effective at removing the worst affected area of lung. New techniques have been developed where emphysema can be treated using a fibre-optic camera called a bronchoscope. Trials have shown that using a bronchoscope to place endobronchial valves into the airways can be very effective in carefully selected patients and the technique is now being adopted in hospitals across the UK.\n\nThis study will collect data from people undergoing these procedures at hospitals across the UK to evaluate how well they work in practice and what factors at baseline influence response.\n\nBaseline, three month and 12 month follow up data will be collected. This will include lung function data, measures of exercise capacity, questionnaires about health status and CT scan results.\n\nQuestions addressed will include:\n\n(1) What lung function improvement is seen in clinical practice?\n\n(2) What factors determine who is most likely to respond?\n\n(3) How safe are the procedures and what is the rate of complications?\n\n(4) What proportion of people undergoing bronchoscopic procedures require repeat procedures or surgery subsequently?\n\n(5) Does long term survival differ between people undergoing the different treatments?\n\nThe study is supported by The British Lung Foundation and sponsored by Imperial College, London. By building collaboration, the establishment of the network will also produce a structure that will make evaluation of future bronchoscopic techniques easier bringing innovative treatments into play more quickly.",

      "description": "This is the bioresource resulting from the United Kingdom Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS), one of the world's largest randomised controlled trials. Between 2001-2005 1.2 million women aged 50-74 years were invited from the general population and 202,638 post-menopausal were randomised (2:1:1) to routine care, or annual CA125 blood testing (7-11 rounds) or ultrasound to evaluate the impact of ovarian cancer screening on disease mortality. All participants provided a serum sample at recruitment with 50,262 providing further longitudinal annual samples (median of 9 samples). Women were free of any active malignancy at enrolment (2001-2005). During the follow-up period of >15 years to-date a proportion of those have subsequently developed a number of different diseases. Available comprehensive electronic health record linkage of the cohort's participants (including Hospital Episode Statistics (HES); ONS (Cancer registry, Death Certificates); National Cancer Intelligence Network (NCIN); and Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP) allows exploiting clinical phenotyping and diseases diagnoses made during routine healthcare in the NHS. Women were also sent postal questionnaires. Secondary studies have to date generated additional data on symptoms, menopause and its management and further details of individual cancers. \nThe biobank contains >540,000 high-quality serum samples (10 x 500\u00ce\u00bcL aliquots in straws), composed of baseline (from >189,000 women) and a unique longitudinal set of >350,000 annual serial samples (median 9) (from approximately 50,200 women). Samples have already been validated for multi-omics analysis with academic and commercial collaborators in nested case/controls sets used for genotyping, proteomics (including SWATH technology), methylation, NMR metabolomics, autoantibody profiling, ELISA-based assays, lipidomics and miRNA.\nWe provide access to collection of samples and data across the following diseases: \n\u2022\tCerebrovascular accident (disorder)\n\u2022\tDementia (disorder)\n\u2022\tFit and well\n\u2022\tHeart disease (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant neoplasm of endometrium of corpus uteri (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of breast, Malignant tumour of colon, Malignant tumour of lung, Malignant tumour of ovary\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of pancreas\nAll data is stored in the IG Toolkit-compliant and ISO 27001:2013-certified UCL Data Safe Haven.\nAll samples from the biobank have been collected using a standardised protocol and stored in liquid nitrogen at HTA licensed facilities at UK Biocentre, Oxford, UK.",

This first release of Moorfields dataset includes metadata describing imaging series comprising of approximately 8million eye images from approx. 2.3million patients attending routine outpatient appointments and ophthalmic accident and emergency from Moorfields\u2019 31 sites across greater London, and includes longitudinal sequential scans. \nThe image data itself is not included in this first release of our dataset, only metadata describing the images available. We plan to make the imaging data itself available in subsequent releases available via this gateway.  \nThe data we provide will have quarterly releases to ensure the data is current and continually improving to maximise its viability for research. \nThe metadata includes eye imaging modalities such as optical coherence tomography (OCT), retinal photographs (including ultra-wide field imaging, CP-Colour Photo, IRP-Infrared Photo, FA-Fluorescein Angiography, ICGA-Indocyanine Green Angiography, RF-Red Free, AF-Autoflourescence, IRAF-Infrared Autoflourescence, BAF-Blue Autoflourescence) \nA breakdown of existing image types and numbers of images are given below:\nOptical coherence tomography: 3-dimensional cross-sectional imaging of the retina.\nTopcon OCT: 2.3m volume scans\nHeidelberg OCT: 370K volume scans \nZeiss OCT: 32K volume scans\n\nRetinal photographs: 2-dimensional single photographs of the fundus\nTopcon: CP-2.4M, IRP-2M\nHeidelberg: FA-100K, ICGA-38K, IRAF-1K, IRP-400K, RF-1K\nZeiss: CP-47K, IRP-3K",

      "description": "The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) nationally representative general practice sentinel network and database\nNational primary care sentinel network:\nThe RCGP RSC is nationally representative a network of over 500 general practices (GP) providing pseudonymised data for weekly surveillance of infectious diseases; our data are also available for quality improvement, research and education.  Research based on the RCGP RSC data have been published in the best journals including BMJ, Lancet and Diabetes Care.\nObservational research\nThe disease surveillance program is commissioned by Public Health England (PHE) and covers 37 infectious diseases including influenza. The RCGP RSC is a nationally representative population.  The RCGP RSC and PHE, and its predecessor organizations have an over 50-year history of collaboration in influenza and respiratory disease surveillance and vaccine effectiveness studies.  Each practice in the network is reported on by all 37 infectious disease on a weekly basis and are graphically compared with the network as a whole (on their own web based dashboard); this drives both quality improvement in clinical care and also raises data quality, with our practice liaison team providing timely support to practices requiring help with any disparities in their information.  Thus, the observational researcher benefits from a data warehouse of patient level records going back decades with consistently coded data, able to support both longitudinal and cross-sectional study designs.\nInterventional research \u2013 ambition to be a hub for trials \nThe RCGP RSC has produced a \u2018Weekly Return\u2019 of infections and respiratory disease since 1967, though over time it has expanded in terms of size, scope, sample collection and its capability with linking with other datasets. The databases systems at the RCGP RSC can process large numbers of patients\u2019 data rapidly. The typical duration for generating the weekly report is under 4 hours. The weekly report reached its highest denominator of 3 million patients in last week of October 2019.\nThe RCGP RSC hosts Workload Observatory (funded by NHS England) for GPs to understand trends of patients with multiple and more complex conditions. Using disease specific dashboards, general practices are provided weekly updated data quality indicators and comparison with other practices in the RCGP RSC network. This process allows practices to continuously improve their data quality and increase the quality of the RCGP RSC studies over time.\nWe regularly administer questionnaires in our studies and are experienced in collecting samples from our network of practices.  Practice level support from our dedicated practice liaison team is enhanced by our suite of dashboard technologies delivering rapid feedback to each of our practices. Hence combing our expertise in real world data analysis, high frequency of practice support and our continual development of internet-based practice level interaction, we are well placed for providing a low cost pragmatic trials platform for quality improvement studies or as a medicinal trials platform. \n\nClinical concepts are ontologically defined for clinical concepts as part of developing a study protocol.  We have clinical and programming expertise to assist researchers in developing new ontologies for case finding and have a pool of existing ontologies and associated computer algorithms for extracting the data.  \n\n\nWe have ongoing research across a wide range of medical areas, with international collaborations in child health, diabetes and influenza vaccination and have an extensive set of data extraction, processing and analytic procedures we have developed which are readily available to existing and new research collaborators.",

This may often take the form of a dashboard and quality improvement activity, domain related but under the editorial control of RCGP RSC. \nCosting process \nApplicants will be responsible for any costs associated with data extraction and other aspects of collaboration. Costs are kept to a minimum. However, a RCGP RSC Practice Development Fund contribution in included to develop benefits and data quality in member practices.  Broadly 10% of the value of contracts is reinvested into member practices, in addition to any payments for research work undertaken. \nAny potential costs will be discussed at the monthly RCGP RSC Operational meeting, held each month, and researchers will be contacted as soon after the meeting as possible. Data extraction can start once these costs have been through a University approval process and formal agreements are in place.\nFor studies requiring active participation of General Practices, a contribution to cover practice staff members\u2019 time and expenses will be expected.  This is set broadly in line with National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) levels of charges for practice time.\nPlease contact the RCGP RSC team via the webpage https://www.rcgp.org.uk/clinical-and-research/our-programmes/research-and-surveillance-centre.aspx.

      "description": "To identify and enrol participants for the 100,000 Genomes Project we have created NHS Genomic Medicine Centres (GMCs). Each centre includes several NHS Trusts and hospitals. GMCs recruit and consent patients. They then provide DNA samples and clinical information for analysis.\n\nIllumina, a biotechnology company, have been commissioned to sequence the DNA of participants. They return the whole genome sequences to Genomics England. We have created a secure, monitored, infrastructure to store the genome sequences and clinical data. The data is analysed within this infrastructure and any important findings, like a diagnosis, are passed back to the patient\u2019s doctor.\n\nTo help make sure that the project brings benefits for people who take part, we have created the Genomics England Clinical Interpretation Partnership (GeCIP). GeCIP brings together funders, researchers, NHS teams and trainees. They will analyse the data \u2013 to help ensure benefits for patients and an increased understanding of genomics. The data will also be used for medical and scientific research. This could be research into diagnosing, understanding or treating disease.\n\nFind out more\n\nTo learn more about how we work you can read the 100,000 Genomes Project protocol. It has details of the development, delivery and operation of the project. It also sets out the patient and clinical benefit, scientific and transformational objectives, the implementation strategy and the ethical and governance frameworks.",

      "description": "The UK MND Collections (formerly known as the UK MND DNA Bank) was established to provide the international research community with a resource that would help to identify and understand the causative and disease modifying factors involved with motor neurone disease. These samples are available for research into MND and associated conditions such as fronto-temporal dementia only.\nThe UK MND Collections combines more than 3,000 biological samples and accompanying clinical information; as well as epidemiology data from 400 participants, including people with MND, controls and family members.\nThe DNA Bank was the original Collection of whole genome DNA from over 3,000 blood samples, which are stored at CIGMR (Centre for Integrated Genomic Medical Research) in Manchester, UK. The DNA Bank also has clinical information (divided into a minimum and extended dataset) which is available to researchers.\nThe Cell Lines Collection offers a sub set of the DNA Bank samples as EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes. This was originally set up as an everlasting supply of DNA, with the lymphoblastoid cell lines now available to researchers to help them understand how the disease is developing.\nThe Epidemiology Collection has just over 200 patient and matched control blood samples with extensive environmental and lifestyle data (both from self-report questionnaires and telephone interviews) available to researchers.\nMore information on the DNA and cell bank is available in Smith et al BMC Genetics (2015) 16:84.",

Secondary objectives include: progression-free survival, overall survival and safety and tolerability of cediranib in ASPS patients. Tissue markers of tumour response, circulating markers of angiogenesis, and changes in circulating endothelial cells/precursor cells in response to cediranib will be explored.  Thirty six patients with progressive, metastatic, histologically confirmed ASPS will be recruited. Patients will be randomised to 24 weeks of blinded cediranib or placebo, after which treatment will be unblinded and all patients offered open-label cediranib until objective disease progression, or death if sooner.",

      "description": "Background:\nThe Leeds Biobanking and Sample Processing Lab (LBSPL) is based at St James's University Hospital and is an important element in the Leeds Clinical Research Facility (LCRF). LBSPL is dedicated to providing a sample processing service for clinical trials, and for many biobanking activities within the University and Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust.  These currently include collections of tissue, and fluid samples such as blood and urine obtained from consented patients diagnosed with kidney, bladder, colorectal and ovarian cancer, brain tumours, and patients undergoing renal transplant. These are processed and stored in research tissue banks (Leeds Multidisciplinary RTB and Leeds NIHR Biomarker RTB) and used as a valuable resource for wider research activities.\nThe Leeds Multidisciplinary Research Tissue Bank (RTB) was given favourable ethical opinion by the Leeds (East) Research Ethics Committee on 3rd March 2010 and renewed 5 years later (Current REC ref: 15/YH/0080).  \n\nCurrent situation:\nThe LBSPL provides ongoing sample processing support to a variety of local or commercial clinical trials requiring samples to be collected for PK/PD endpoints or other associated translational studies. The Leeds Multidisciplinary RTB currently holds matched normal and malignant frozen renal tissue samples from ~600 patients with renal cancer, and plasma, serum, buffy coat and urine samples from ~800 renal cancer patients either prior to surgery/treatment or during treatment, for example with sunitinib. In addition, fluid samples have been collected from patients with benign urological conditions, healthy controls, patients prior to and following renal transplant A population-based TMA including tissue from ~300 RCC patients has also been established. From having solely a renal focus, the RTB has expanded to now also include frozen normal tissue samples, and frozen tissue and urine samples from >1,000 patients with bladder cancer, frozen tissue from patients with brain tumours and limited samples from patients with ovarian cancer or colorectal cancer (no new collections ongoing in these areas). The Leeds NIHR BioRTB has closed to recruitment and contains a bank of fluid samples from patients with liver disease, renal cancer and patient undergoing renal transplantation. These were collected as part of a multicentre initiative in the UK, together with associated clinical data, and are intended for use in biomarker validation studies.  \n\nSample processing and clinical data:\nSamples are processed according to the relevant quality controlled Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) within Good Clinical Practice (GCLP) laboratories. The dedicated sample processing team of laboratory technicians, administrative staff and a Quality Assurance manager works together to ensure that all samples are handled, processed, stored and tracked to the highest standards. The samples are stored accordingly at the correct temperature (e.g. snap frozen tissue in liquid nitrogen, plasma, serum and buffy coats at -80oC). All freezers and liquid nitrogen dewars which hold patient samples are monitored using the Tutela system, a 24/7 web-based alert response temperature monitoring system.\nFull clinical data is being collected using CRFs. Follow-up data and data available later such as pathology results are obtained from the relevant hospital records/databases by trained personnel with appropriate access. We hope to move to more automated data linkage in the future through working with the Leeds Institute of Data Analytics.  \nTo find further information about collaborative access to these RTB samples please e-mail Roz Banks or Jo Brown at rtb@leeds.ac.uk.",

It is located within UCL Institute of Neurology in the Department of Neuropathology and is governed by a committee including members of the Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, the Epilepsy Society as well as SUDEP Action.\nThe collection comprises consented tissue samples from patients who have undergone epilepsy surgery, mainly at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery. In addition the tissue bank archives whole brain samples from patients with epilepsy and particularly epilepsy-related deaths, such as sudden and unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP).\nWe have a donor registry for people who have epilepsy, seizures or who are healthy, without seizures, who wish to donate brain tissue following death.",

The latest available patient postcode of residence is mapped to an LSOA boundary. The LSOA of residence then allows linkage to the following LSOA-level deprivation measures:\n2004 English Index of Multiple Deprivation; 2007 English Index of Multiple Deprivation; 2010 English Index of Multiple Deprivation; 2015 English Index of Multiple Deprivation (composite and individual domains); Townsend Deprivation Index: calculated using unadjusted 2001 census data; Carstairs Index using 2011 census data.\n\nData are provided as quintiles, deciles or twentiles of the deprivation score to prevent disclosure of patient location. In order to prevent the possibility of deductive disclosure of a patients\u2019 area of residence, researchers will only be provided with one of the above linked datasets for any one study.",

It includes babies in whom anomalies are diagnosed at any time from conception to the end of the first year of life. Data collection commenced on 1st January 1998 and includes any baby where pregnancy ended after this date.\n\nCARIS uses a multi-source data collection method using a wide range of sources within the NHS. This ranges from antenatal ultrasound, clinical letters, post-mortems and laboratory results. CARIS also accesses a number of databases including SHIRE (Medical Genetics database), PEDW, NCCHD, Paediatric Cardiology database. Medical records are accessed to confirm, validate and add further details to the information already collected.\n\nDue to the nature of this dataset linkage based on the babies is challenging. This is because many pregnancies (approximately 20% of the total) end in fetal loss or termination. However, linkage based on the mother can be performed.",

      "description": "A regional asset for Yorkshire and Humber Data, a population-based database of all children and young people (0\u201329 years) diagnosed with cancer residing in the Yorkshire and Humber region in England (10,000 tumour registrations in children aged 0-14 years since 1974 and Adolescents and Young Adults aged 15-29 years since 1990). The database contains detailed information on clinical prognostic factors including detailed treatment and stage information. A unique quality of the Yorkshire Register is that it has pre-linked data with hospital admissions datasets including inpatient, outpatient, A&E, Mental Health HES which has been used to explore long-term morbidity in the cohort. Primary care linked data have been requested and are pending. Linked educational attainment and unemployment/social benefits data are currently being sought (ethical approval in place). Demand is largely underpinned by ongoing epidemiological and cancer\noutcomes requests from University postgraduate researchers, PGT students, and other children\u2019s tumour registers. However, pharma has also requested some of the registry data. Ethics and Research Governance are all current, the former approved as a Research Database by the Northern & Yorkshire MREC (Ref MREC 0/3/1) from which data can be requested by external researchers, and approval from the Health Research Authority Confidentiality Advisory Group to process identifiable patient data without consent (Ref\u2014CAG 1-07(b)/2014). The Register goes beyond the dataset held by NCRAS in having much more rich and detailed treatment histories of every patient through active follow-up so beyond the traditional 6-month window since diagnosis used by NCRAS, as well as more complete tumour staging information. Register also records any cancer recurrence alongside any subsequent treatment received. \n\nThe Yorkshire Specialist Register of Cancer in Children and Young People exists primarily to underpin epidemiological research examining the patterns and causes of cancer in children and young people and to facilitate health services research describing the patient experience in the context of care received by health professionals. The YSRCCYP is an established information resource for local clinicians and commissioners, and forms the basis for national and international collaborative research.\nThe core aims of the YSRCCYP are to:\n\u2022\tMaintain the accurate and complete collection of clinical and socio-demographic data on children, teenagers and young adults with cancer in Yorkshire, specifically information not otherwise available from other routine NHS sources.\n\u2022\tInvestigate the effectiveness of healthcare delivery for children and young people, specifically the impact on survival and long-term health.\n\u2022\tUndertake epidemiological research, comprising incidence and survival analyses.\n\u2022\tDescribe environmental risk factors for childhood and young adult cancer.\n\nExample of three recent research studies by the Yorkshire Register research team are as follows:\n\n1. Respiratory morbidity in young people surviving cancer: Population based study of hospital admissions, treatment related risk factors and subsequent mortality\n(Smith et al, 2019)\n\nRespiratory diseases are a major cause of late morbidity and mortality amongst childhood cancer survivors. This population-based study provides comprehensive analysis of hospitalisations for respiratory conditions, the associated risks of admission by earlier cancer treatment and trends in readmissions and subsequent mortality in long-term survivors of cancers diagnosed under 30 years. The risk of hospitalisation was significantly higher in cancer survivors compared to the general population. Treatment with chemotherapy with known lung toxicity was associated with an increased risk of admissions for all respiratory disease especially pneumonia. Subsequent mortality was highest in those admitted for pneumonia compared to other respiratory conditions.\n\n2. Long term survival after childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: population-based trends in cure and relapse by clinical characteristics\n(Smith et al, 2018)\n\nStatistical \u201ccure models\u201d provide additional metrics useful to identify and describe trends in survival. Additional measures include the proportion cured which is a summary of the long term survival and the median survival of the uncured which give information on those who are not long-term survivors. In this study we used a statistical cure model to explore trends in long-term survival and relapse for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) over time and by clinical characteristics. The proportion of patients cured, defined either by overall survival or relapse free survival, has increased over time while there was slight decrease in the median survival time of the uncured. We also observed a significant reduction in the risk of relapse over time.\n\n3. Comparison of ethnic group classification using naming analysis and routinely collected data\n(Smith et al, 2017)\n\nIn this study we compared cancer incidence trends using different methods for assigning ethnic groups to individuals: 1 \u2013 using ethnic group recorded in hospital medical records, 2 \u2013 using a naming software program to assign an ethnic group based on the ethnic origins of the individuals and 3 \u2013 using a combination of both processes. We found that using different methods of assigning ethnicity can result in different estimates of ethnic variation in cancer incidence. Combining ethnicity from multiple sources results in a more complete estimate of ethnicity than the use of one single source.\n\nhttps://medicinehealth.leeds.ac.uk/leeds-institute-cardiovascular-metabolic-medicine/doc/yorkshire-specialist-register-cancer-children-young-people",

This cohort has been utilised in our recent GWAS of Moderate-Severe asthma (PMID: 30552067). \n\nThe cohort is currently ~4,000 individuals and to date 2,536 individuals have Affymetrix Axion array data that has completed QC imputed to provide 33M variants.

We are also interested in whether exposure to air pollution in childhood leaves markers on genes that reflect pollution levels over time.We have recruited over 3,300 primary school pupils across London and Luton to take part from 44 London schools and 41 Luton schools. These children will be assessed once a year for up to four years.",

They sample the population range and are anonymised prior to archiving (retaining age, sex, date of collection and source laboratory only). Collection of sera is continuing through collaboration with the PHE Microbiology Services Division (MSD) and some NHS laboratories throughout England, and has occurred annually since 1986.  Over 230,000 sera are now stored and catalogued. The collection can be made available for testing to anyone wishing to use it to address issues related to public health policy.",

The survey was conducted by Quality Health in conjunction with three cancer registries in England. The survey measured the overall quality of life of representative samples of cancer survivors with breast, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL) diagnosed during July 2006 - July 2010. Quality of life was assessed at four different time points after diagnosis at approximately one, two, three or five years. As this was a pilot survey, numbers are small and data governance issues will need to be carefully considered on a study by study basis. Outcome items in the survey are made up of Euroqol 5-level (EQ-5D), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT), and Social Difficulties Inventory (SDI) items.",

To aid in user needs, timely but provisional counts of death registrations in England and Wales are pubilshed weekly, monthly, and quarterly. Annual mortality statistics (based on deaths registered in a calendar year) are published in separate packages to enable the timely release of statistics. From 1974 to 2005, mortality statistics were published in the annual reference volumns, DH1, DH2, and DH4. From 1993 to 2005, figures were based on deaths occurring annually in England and Wales in the reference year. Prior to 1993, figures were based on deaths registered in England and Wales in the reference year. In 2006, these three volumes were replaced by a single publication, Mortality statistics: deaths registered in England and Wales (Series DR) based on deaths registered in a reference year.",

It intends to extend recruitment in all areas, and to other rare and common disease groups, with a target of ~300k by 2022. The NIHR BioResource acquires samples at recruitment for each participant recruited. With the exception of the GLAD study, which posts saliva kits direct to participants\u2019 homes, the preferred sample collection is 3 blood tubes \u2013 see https://bioresourcesupport.org.uk/live-samples/ - from which DNA can be extracted, and plasma and sera stored.  In many clinics, the NIHR BioResource blood draw follows immediately the blood collection for routine healthcare purposes.  In the case of children, less blood will be taken, down to 1mL. The Technical Metadata describes the standard used by RD-Connect, the EU-wide Rare Disease biobank consortium - https://samples.rd-connect.eu/menu/main/home. During 2020, this will be replaced by an API from the UK CRC Tissue Directory, as using this discovery tool is a condition of running a Research Tissue Bank in the UK.",

Data on patients seen by GP Out of Hours (OOH) services across Scotland are collected and maintained by ISD in the national data warehouse known as the GP OOH datamart. Data is collected on local IT system (Adastra), then extracted and submitted to the DataMart on a weekly basis.",

      "description": "The data is derived from linked primary, secondary and tertiary care electronic health records and participant survey responses. Data is de-identified at source (Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust (LTHT) and ResearchOne) and linked using matching pseudonymous digests that are re-pseudonymised upon linkage by University of Leeds IT to produce irreversibly pseudonymous data that is processed into a research dataset. The data relates to the medical history of cancer patients prior to cancer, during their cancer diagnosis and treatment, and following their long-term outcomes, and the medical history of matched non-cancer patients that form a comparator cohort.\n\nThe data relates to 431,352 patients in the UK that LTHT have a \u2018legitimate patient relationship\u2019 with and that were determined by LTHT to have had a cancer diagnosis between 2004 and 2018 or be a matched non-cancer patient. Where available, data from ResearchOne provides primary care information for these patients. Where the patients were invited to participate in a patient reported outcomes measures survey (PROMS), this status is recorded. Where the patient returned a consented PROMS, the PROMS data will also be available once it has completed the extract, transform and load process. \n\nThe dataset is currently 5.7 GB and further ResearchOne and PROMS data is anticipated. The dataset is arranged as a relational database, with tables linking on the patient level by a pseudonymous digest. Each table is a comma separated values (CSV) file and relates to an event type, such as prescription cost, address history or diagnosis. All patients have an entry (row) in the demographics table; the number of times a patient has an entry in the other tables depends on how many events of that type were recorded for the patient. \n\nThe dataset is split into two files, each with similar table structure; the main dataset contains all patients and the PROMs dataset contains only those in the PROMs cohort (for whom additional PROMs data will be added). Each table has a re-pseudonymised digest field, \u201cDigest2\u201d and an indicator as to whether the patient has data from ResearchOne available, \u201cTPP_Linked\u201d (0 or 1). Additional fields per table are defined in Table 1. No fields contain sensitive information.",

In addition CEHRB stores haemato-oncology and oncology samples which are specifically taken for the biobank, usually in response to a specific project.\nCEHRB is housed within the WMRGL which is accredited by United Kingdom Accreditation Services to ISO15189:2012. The WMRGL serves a population of about 6 million and is the largest UK NHS genetics lab. Due to the large patient population CEHRB is able to collate sufficient research material from all classifications of neoplastic haematological disorders including those that are rare.",

The DID captures information about referral source and patient type, details of the test (type of test and body site), plus items about waiting times for each diagnostic imaging event, from time of test request through to time of reporting. \nHES DID enables analysis of demographic and geographic variation in access to different test types and different providers, enabling users to analyse patient care pathways.",

      "description": "Rare Disease data are presented at the level of Rare Disease families (families of probands), Rare Disease pedigrees, and participants. Participants are individuals who have consented to be part of the project with the expectation that a sample of their DNA will be obtained and their genome sequenced. Pedigree members are extended members of the proband\u2019s family, this includes participants as well a small amounts of deidentified data recorded to allow a full picture of the proband\u2019s extended family. This additional information is extracted from the proband\u2019s medical record.\n\nAll Rare Disease table names are prefixed with \u201crare_diseases_\u201d.\n\nData at the Level of Rare Disease Families:\n\nrare_diseases_family:\n\nData describing the families of rare disease probands participating in the 100,000 Genomes Project. It includes the family group type, the status of the family\u2019s pre-interpretation clinical review and the settings that were chosen for the interpretation pipeline at the clinical review.\n\nrare_diseases_pedigree:\n\nData describing the Rare Disease participants, linking pedigrees to probands and their family members.\n\nrare_diseases_pedigree_member:\n\nData describing the Rare Disease pedigree members, similar to the data about each individual participant in the participant table (common data view, see section 8.2). It may also include additional data, such as the age of onset of predominant clinical features; data on links to other family members; as well as data collected only for Phenotypes.\n\nData at the Level of Rare Disease Participants.\n\nThe data presented in these tables provides information on disease progression and pertinent medical history:\n\nrare_diseases_participant_disease:\n\nData describing the rare disease participants' disease type/subtype assigned to them upon enrolment, and the date of diagnosis.\n\nrare_diseases_participant_phenotype:\n\nData describing the Rare Disease participants\u2019 phenotypes. For each Rare Disease participant in the 100,000 Genomes Project, there are data about whether a phenotypic abnormality as defined by an HPO term is present and what the HPO term is, as well as the age of onset, the severity of manifestation, the spatial pattern in the body and whether it is progressive or not. Please note that these data are only available for a subset of the rare disease participants.\n\nrare_diseases_gen_measurement:\n\nFor Rare Disease participants in the 100,000 Genomes Project, this table contains general measurements relevant to the disease, alongside the date that the measurements were taken on. Please note that these data are only available for a subset of the rare disease participants.\n\nrare_diseases_early_childhood_observation:\n\nFor Rare Disease participants in the 100,000 Genomes Project, this table contains measurements and milestones provided by the GMCs, related to childhood development. Please note that these data are only available for a subset of the rare disease participants.\n\nrare_diseases_imaging\n\nFor Rare Disease participants in the 100,000 Genomes Project, this table contains various data and measurements from past scans, alongside the date of the scans. Please note that these data are only available for a subset of the rare disease participants.\n\nrare_diseases_invest_genetic:\n\nFor a proportion of Rare Disease participants in the 100,000 Genomes Project, this table contains information on any genetic tests carried out. Data characterising the genetic investigation is recorded alongside records of the sample tissue source and the type of testing laboratory. Please note that these data are only available for a subset of the rare disease participants.\n\nrare_diseases_invest_genetic_test_result:\n\nFor a proportion of Rare Disease participants in the 100,000 Genomes Project, this table contains the results of any genetic tests carried out. Following on from the rare_diseases_invest_genetic table, a summary of the results is presented and contextualised by testing method and scope. Please note that these data are only available for a subset of the rare disease participants.\n\nrare_diseases_invest_blood_laboratory_test_report:\n\nFor a proportion of Rare Disease participants in the 100,000 Genomes Project, this table contains the results of any blood tests carried out. Over 400 blood values are recorded alongside type and technique of testing and the status of the participating patient in the care pathway. Please note that these data are only available for a subset of the rare disease participants.",

      "description": "In collaboration with York Teaching Hospital NHS Trust, the University of York has established the York Tissue Bank: a tissue bank to help research into human disease. We aim to collect, store and build a repository of human tissue samples, such as urine, blood and tumours. These can then be given to researchers for their studies. These studies will aim to improve our understanding of human health and potentially lead to new methods of diagnosis, better treatments and vaccines for a wide range of diseases. We rely on participants to voluntarily gift their tissue samples for this vital future research.\nOur Bioresource is described in detail here: https://openbioresources.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/ojb.49/",

      "description": "HCV Research UK is a UK-wide consortium established in 2011 to underpin research into hepatitis C (HCV).  This was achieved by establishing a biorepository and clinical research database. The biorepository is housed in the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, directed by Dr John McLauchlan and managed by Dr Sarah McDonald. Samples have been obtained from around 10,000 patients.\nAccess to samples and data is governed by a Tissue and Data Access Committee (TDAC). These are reviewed for ethical and scientific merit by TDAC and a decision reached. \nSerum and plasma are obtained from all patients in the cohort. Buffy coats are also collected, and DNA can be extracted when required. Additionally, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and PAX gene tubes are held for smaller cohorts of patients. The extensive clinical data collected complements the biorepository and allows selection of samples from patients with characteristics of interest.\nSub-cohorts:\n-\tSerial samples from patients who were treated as part of the NHS England Early Access Program.\n-\tYearly samples from cirrhotic patients (beginning 2015)\n-\tSpontaneous resolvers\n-\tSmall paediatric cohort\nClinical Data\n-\tBasic demographics including place of birth and ethnicity\n-\tHistory of HCV infection including exposure to risk factors and dates\n-\tDate of diagnosis, date of first attendance at clinic\n-\tCo-morbidities and co-medications at time of enrolment\n-\tLiver disease status and how diagnosed\n-\tTreatment status at enrolment; \n-\tSocial history including alcohol, cigarettes, cannabis; BMI\n-\tHCV RNA status, viral load and genotype/subtype\n-\tHistorical data from the patients' notes regarding previous treatment episodes (dates, regimen, viral loads, outcome) and liver biopsies\n-\tLaboratory data including imaging and fibroscan;\n-\tNew treatment episodes and changes in liver disease status are recorded over time, as are any newly developed co-morbidities.\nAll data generated by researchers who access our biorepository must be returned into the database. Over time this will include host genetics, full length viral sequences, immunophenotyping and biomarker studies.",

There is a growing body of evidence that using dose-fractionated paclitaxel in particular may have increased anti-tumour effects, and this is thought to be due to enhanced anti-angiogenic and pro-apoptotic effects.",

      "description": "NHS Wales hospital admissions (Inpatients and daycases) dataset comprising of attendance and clinical information for all hospital admissions: includes diagnoses and operations performed. Includes spell and episode level data.\nThe data are collected and coded at each hospital. Administrative information is collected from the central PAS (Patient Administrative System), such as specialty of care, admission and discharge dates. After the patient is discharged the handwritten patient notes are transcribed by clinical coder into medical coding terminology (ICD10 and OPCS).\n\nThe data held in PEDW is of interest to public health services since it can provide information regarding both health service utilisation and also the incidence and prevalence of disease. However, since PEDW was created to track hospital activity from the point of view of payments for services, rather than epidemiological analysis, the use of PEDW for public health work is not straightforward. For example:\n\nCounts will vary depending on the number of diagnosis fields used e.g. primary only, all fields;\nThere are a number of different things that can be counted in PEDW e.g. individual episodes of care, admissions, discharges, periods of continuous care (group of episodes), patients or procedures.\nWhen looking at diagnosis or procedures the number will vary depending on whether you look at only in the primary diagnosis / procedure field or if the secondary fields are also included.\nCoding practices vary. In particular, coding practices for recording secondary diagnoses is likely to vary for different hospitals. This makes regional variations more difficult to interpret. The validation process led by the Corporate Health Improvement Programme and implemented by NWIS is aiming to address some of these inconsistencies.\n\nDue to the complexity and pitfalls of PEDW it is recommended that any PEDW requests for public health purposes are discussed with a member of the SAIL team. In turn the SAIL will seek advice from NWIS if required.",

      "description": "The Welsh Health Survey informs local government, NHS, and nationwide health strategy.\n\nThe Welsh Health Survey (WHS) collects information on the health and health-related lifestyles of people living in Wales. It is a major source of information about the health of people in Wales, the way the NHS is used, and behaviours that can affect health, such as smoking and alcohol consumption.\n\nData for the WHS is collected via face-to-face-interviews and self-completion questionnaires. The sampling unit for the WHS are households, however all adults within households were asked to take part. Families with children under the age of 16 are eligible, however where the household has 3 or more children, up to two children between the ages of 0 and 15 are randomly selected for inclusion in the study. Interviews are used to collect data at the household level, with questionnaires distributed to household members. Information on the household type and employment status of the household reference person are collected, and the interviewer is asked to comment on the condition of the property. Separate self-completion questionnaires are used to collect data for adults and young people (aged 13-15), whilst adults/guardians are required to complete questionnaires on behalf of children younger than 13 years old.\n\nThe WHS data, as provided via the UK Data Archive, is split into two separate datasets, these relating to adults \u2013 16 and older \u2013 and children. The WHS can be analysed at both the individual and household level, with appropriate weights being supplied for each. The dataset provides a household identifier which allows for adult-child records to be combined for research exploring \u2018household\u2019 health or the links between parental and child health, for example.",

      "description": "The Wales Cancer Bank (WCB) was set up in 2004 and consented the first patient in 2005. The project is hosted by Cardiff University and receives funding from the Welsh Government, Cancer Research Wales and Velindre Charitable funds.\nA Cancer Bank is literally a collection of tissue and blood which has been collected from patients where cancer is a possible diagnosis and is being stored to facilitate future research into cancer.\nStatistics suggest that four out of ten people will be diagnosed with cancer at some point during their life. Cancers are complex diseases and it is an on-going quest to understand how they develop, spread and can be treated. The development of more effective, targeted treatment for cancer depends on increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the initiation of the tumour, its progression to metastatic disease and response and resistance to treatment. Research studies rely on the availability of high quality biological material from patients with cancer and large studies are needed to correlate biology with clinical outcome.\nThe Welsh population is relatively stable and this makes it an ideal cohort to collect and study. Linkage with the all Wales cancer clinical database (CANISC) enables good correlation of science with clinical follow-up. This will eventually enable the results from hundreds of research projects to be integrated and linked to clinical outcome and this will be an invaluable source of data for bioinformatics specialists to examine. All the data collected is being stored on a database housed in the NHS to ensure security and confidentiality.\nThe WCB currently consents patients in 12 hospitals around Wales with specially trained research nurses and clinical teams.\nWe provide access to collection of samples and data across the following diseases: \n\u2022\tHodgkin's disease (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant neoplasm of connective tissue (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant neoplasm of endometrium of corpus uteri (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant neoplasm of skin\n\u2022\tMalignant neoplasm of upper respiratory tract (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of adrenal gland (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of anal canal (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of biliary tract (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of cervix\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of kidney (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of nasal sinuses (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of oral cavity (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of penis (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of prostate (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of salivary gland (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of small intestine (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of stomach (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of testis (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of thyroid gland (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of urinary bladder (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of vagina (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of vulva (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of breast\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of colon\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of lung\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of oesophagus\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of ovary\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of pancreas",

      "description": "The current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, represents a major threat to health in the UK and globally. To fully understand the transmission and evolution of the virus requires sequencing and analysing viral genomes at scale and speed. The numbers of samples calls for a rapid increase in the UK\u2019s pathogen genome sequencing capacity rapidly and robustly.\n\nTo provide this increased capacity to collect, sequence and analyse the whole genomes of virus samples in the UK, the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium is pooling the world leading knowledge and expertise in genomics of the four UK Public Health Agencies, multiple regional University hubs, and large sequencing centres such as the Wellcome Sanger Institute.",

The general practice postcode is linked via Lower Super Output Area (LSOA), Super Output Area (SOA) in Northern Ireland and datazone (DZ) in Scotland.\n\nThe general practice postcode linkage includes several well-known area-based measures of deprivation, of which two are available at the LSOA level for linkage to CPRD primary care data through the practice postcode. These measures are: 2015 English Index of Multiple Deprivation (composite and individual domains); 2016 Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (composite and individual domains); 2017 Northern Ireland Index of Multiple Deprivation (composite and individual domains); 2014 Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation (composite and individual domains)\nCarstairs Index: England, Wales and Scotland calculated using 2011 census data.\n\nAs standard, the most recent national Indices of Deprivation are provided for each country. It is important to note that the IMD indices are not comparable between countries in the UK. Older versions of the deprivation scores can be provided on request. The data are updated monthly. data are provided as quintiles or deciles of the deprivation score to prevent disclosure of patient location. In order to prevent the possibility of deductive disclosure of the location of a practice, researchers will only be provided with one of the above linked datasets for any one study.",

      "description": "ALSPAC was established to understand how genetic, biological, environmental, social, psychological and psychosocial factors influence the health and development of children and their parents. ALSPAC is a multi-generation prospective cohort based in Bristol in the South West of England. More than 14,000 women (G0) were enrolled in 1991 and 1992. Their partners (also G0), children (G1) and now grandchildren (G2) have been recruited and followed up over multiple timepoints. A wide variety of biological samples have been collected along with a vast array of exposure and outcome data collected via questionnaire, face to face clinics and through linkage to administrative data.\n\nDuring the index pregnancy women were sent 3 questionnaires. Since then, over a period of some 25 years, women have been sent almost annual questionnaires asking about their own health and well-being. From 2008, women were invited to attend four focus clinical assessments. Assessments of the children have been administered frequently, with multiple data collection time points since birth. These include numerous child-completed questionnaires, a number of clinical assessments from the age of 7 years and further questionnaires about the child completed by the mother or other main caregiver. Partners of the mothers have also completed a number of questionnaires and been invited to one focus clinic assessment. The second generation (children of the children) have been and continue to be recruited with data collected via questionnaire and clinical assessment at multiple time points.\n\nDataset has multiple releases (not scheduled)",

PROMs are a means of collecting information on the effectiveness of care delivered to NHS patients as perceived by the patients themselves. The collection of this data will add to the set of information available on the care delivered to NHS-funded patients and will complement, and be used in conjunction with, existing information on the quality of services. Data was released for the first time as an experimental statistic in April 2010 at which time the extract service was also launched. \n\nThe PROMs dataset is made up of many data items relating to information collected through the Patient Reported Outcome Measures questionnaires completed by patients for a number of common elective procedures. Patients submit the questionnaires before and after their operation in order to establish their perceived levels of health and the impact the operation has had on their quality of life. The PROMs dataset includes responses to individual questions as well as overall totals for a number of different scoring systems for both pre-operative and post-operative questionnaires",

      "description": "The NIHR Bioresource consists of several groups of participants: ~70k from the general population and blood donors (COMPARE, INTERVAL and STRIDES studies); ~19k with one of ~50 rare diseases (RD) including a ~5k pilot for GEL; ~30k with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) which include the members of the HDR UK IBD Hub; and ~20k with Anxiety or depression (GLAD study). It intends to extend recruitment in all areas, and to other rare and common disease groups, with a target of ~300k by 2022. The NIHR BioResource acquires a self-reported health and lifestyle questionnaire from all participants at recruitment, save those recruited in rare disease clinics.  Typically variables include height, weight, smoking history and alcohol consumption, with addition of questions relating to disease history and current medications. This is used to pre-screen or match participants when inviting them to take part in experimental medicine studies.  De-identified versions of this data is available to researchers investigating the feasibility of future studies. Note: Valid metadata in DDI XML format was uploaded to the HDR UK metadata helpdesk.  While an entirely appropriate schema for capturing rich metadata, it could not be readily transformed to meet the Technical Metadata standards, which is (therefore) a poor approximation.",

The data items in the LUCADA dataset have been compiled to meet the requirements of audit, and are not to be confused with the data items identified as Lung Cancer in the National Cancer dataset. The audit focuses on measuring the care given to lung cancer patients from diagnosis to the primary treatment package, assessing against standards and bringing about necessary improvements. The project supports the Calman Hine recommendations, the National Cancer Plan and other national guidance (e.g. NICE guidance) as it emerges.\nAs above. Different schema to lucada_2013.",

It includes Study Team for Early Life Asthma Research (STELAR), which includes Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), Ashford and Isle of Wight cohorts (IoW), Manchester Asthma and Allergy Study (MAAS), Aberdeen Study of Eczema and Asthma To Observe the Effects of Nutrition (SEATON); Breathing Together; U-BIOPRED; and the Royal Brompton Severe Asthma cohort (paediatric) cohorts. When/where possible these data are to be linked to NHS data.\n\nAsthma and allergic diseases (food allergies, rhinitis, eczema) are the most common chronic diseases in childhood and adolescence. They usually start before school-age and are responsible for a heavy burden of ill health, including premature death. In response, we propose an innovative scientific research program which embraces a truly trans-disciplinary team science approach, and is of fundamental relevance both to biomedical research and to evidence-based health science more broadly. UNICORN builds directly on the substantive prior investments in both the science and infrastructure underpinning research in this domain. The project will assist UK to leverage its cohort studies with a focus on asthma and allergy more productively, and to develop a sustainable, scalable scientific infrastructure to facilitate future work in this and other biomedical domains.",

It can be caused by a variety of single gene defects, including conditions such as retinitis pigmentosa which often result in early onset blindness in childhood, whilst the risk of age related macular degeneration is caused by a variety of complex multigene defects causing visual loss in later life. Treatments are evolving for both diseases but the underlying pathogenesis and treatment of these diseases  remains elusive. We  have formed the biobank as a repository of fibroblasts (from skin and hair samples) from patients with a variety of retinal diseases that could then be used with induced pluripotent stem cell technology  to investigate causes and new treatments for these conditions.",

It intends to extend recruitment in all areas, and to other rare and common disease groups, with a target of ~300k by 2022. The NIHR BioResource acquires demographic details \u2013 e.g. age, sex, ethnicity - from participants at recruitment.

We can collect samples into a wide range of anticoagulant tubes, blood bags and other devices as required.\nProcessing\nWe use advanced technologies in our laboratory to test donated blood samples and to process them into the formats which are most useful to researchers. These include:\nWhole blood\n From a single tube of whole blood in a specific anticoagulant tube, up to a full bag of blood we can collect the exact volume of blood you need from donors best suited to your study and deliver it within precisely defined timeframes at the best temperature for your need.\nBuffy coat\n We routinely process whole blood units into buffy coat preparations which are used as a source of PBMCs by our clients. We can also process smaller volumes of blood from blood collection tubes into buffy coat.\nPlasma\n We can either collect a specific volume of blood in the anticoagulant of your choice and prepare plasma, or you can source plasma samples that we have banked from a wide selection of donors for screening purposes.\nSerum\n We can either collect a specific volume of blood and prepare serum to suit your needs, or you can select from serum samples that we have previously banked from a wide selection of donors.\nPBMCs\n We are preparing PBMCs from whole units of blood within a very short timeframe from venepuncture (typically processing begins within 1 hour). PBMCs are produced using a density centrifugation, characterized and frozen in a proprietary freezing solution designed to maximise cell viability.\nCustom services\n We can develop specific processes to suit your exact requirements, so please get in contact if there is something specific you need for your research",

          "description": "Data for all cancer participants whose genomes have been through Genomics England bioinformatics interpretation and passed quality checks, including: sex, ethnicity, disease recruited for and diagnosis; tumour ID, build of latest genome, QC status of latest genome and path to latest genomes; as well file paths to the genomes. This table includes information derived from laboratory_sample and cancer_participant_tumour.\n\n\nSome key data included in the table are elucidated below:\n\n \nGlobal Tumour Mutation Burden\n\nThis is the number of somatic non-synonymous small variants per megabase of coding sequences (32.61 Mb). This metric was calculated using somatic_small_variants_annotation_vcf as input (see below for description) and all non-PASS variants were removed from the calculation.\n\n\n\nTumour purity\n\nThis is the tumour purity (cancer cell fraction) as calculated by Ccube (https://rdrr.io/github/keyuan/ccube/)\n\n\n\nMutational Signatures\n\nThe table includes the relative proportions of the different mutational signatures demonstrated by the tumour. Analysis of large sequencing datasets (10,952 exomes and 1,048 whole-genomes from 40 distinct tumour types) has allowed patterns of relative contextual frequencies of different SNVs to be grouped into specific mutational signatures. Using mathematical methods (decomposition by non-negative least squares) the contribution of each of these signatures to the overall mutation burden observed in a tumour can be derived. Further details of the 30 different mutational signatures used for this analysis, their prevalence in different tumour types and proposed aetiology can be found at the Sanger Institute Website: http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/census.\n\n\n\nCancer PCA QC Statistics\n\nThe cancer analysis pipeline employs a sequencing quality control check which selects several important statistics associated with the sequencing returned by the sequencing provider, and uses them to check whether or not the sample in question is an outlier with respect to previous samples that have been run through the pipeline. It is, in effect, a safety net that can spot issues that have occurred at the tissue collection stage (i.e. at the GMC (Genomic Medicine Centre)) or at the library preparation step (i.e. at the sequencing provider), both of which may impact upon the final genomic analysis returned to the clinician.\n\n\n\nSomatic small variants annotation vcf filepaths\n\nThe somatic_small_variants_annotation_vcf column contains file paths pointing to VCFs containing Genomics England flags for potential false positive variants as well as additional annotations (see VCF header for details).  Swift and PolyPhen scores as well as new PONnoise50SNV flag were added. The flags used for annotation are:\n\ni. CommonGermlineVariant: variants with a population germline allele frequency above 1% in a Genomics England dataset\n\nii. CommonGnomADVariant: variants with a population germline allele frequency above 1% in gnomAD dataset\n\niii. RecurrentSomaticVariant: recurrent somatic variants with frequency above 5% in a Genomics England dataset\n\niv. SimpleRepeat: variants overlapping simple repeats as defined by Tandem Repeats Finder\n\nv. BCNoiseIndel: small indels in regions with high levels of sequencing noise where at least 10% of the basecalls in a window extending 50 bases to either side of the indel\u2019s call have been filtered out by Strelka due to the poor quality\n\nvi. PONnoise50SNV: SNVs resulting from systematic mapping and calling artefacts\n\nThe following methodology was used for the PONnoise50SNV flag: the ratio of tumour allele depths at each somatic SNV site was tested to see if it is significantly different to the ratio of allele depths at this site in a panel of normals (PoN) using Fisher\u2019s exact test. The PoN was composed of a cohort of 7000 non-tumour genomes from the Genomics England dataset, and at each genomic site only individuals not carrying the relevant alternate allele were included in the count of allele depths. The mpileup function in bcftools v1.9 was used to count allele depths in the PoN, and to replicate Strelka filters duplicate reads were removed and quality thresholds set at mapping quality >= 5 and base quality >= 5. All somatic SNVs with a Fisher\u2019s exact test phred score < 50 were filtered, this threshold minimised the loss of true positive variants while still gaining significant improvement in specificity of SNV calling as calculated from a TRACERx truth set. A presentation entitled PONnoise50SNV: SNVs resulting from systematic mapping and calling artefacts, which further outlines the methodology, can be found in the Publications and other useful links table located on this page: https://cnfl.extge.co.uk/display/GERE/10.+Further+reading+and+documentation\n\n\nAlignment BAM files generated by Isaac Genome Alignment Software\n\nA paper written by GeCIP members discussing the issue of reference bias in the computation of variant allele frequencies (VAFs) by the Illumina Isaac pipeline (caused by preferential soft clipping of reads supporting alternate alleles) can be located here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/836171v1",

Furthermore, it is anticipated that these biomarkers will help predict fibrotic activity that may identify patterns of disease behaviour with greater accuracy than current clinical phenotyping.\n\n200 participants with the multidisciplinary team confirmed fibrotic lung disease (50 each of rheumatoid-interstitial lung disease (ILD), asbestosis, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis and unclassifiable ILD) and 50 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis participants, recruited as positive controls, will be followed up for 2 years. Participants will have blood samples, lung function tests, quality of life questionnaires and a subgroup will be offered bronchoscopy. Participants will also be given the option of undertaking blinded home handheld spirometry for the first 3 months of the study. The primary end point will be identification of a biomarker that predicts disease progression, defined as 10% relative change in forced vital capacity (FVC) or death at 12 months.",

It intends to extend recruitment in all areas, and to other rare and common disease groups, with a target of ~300k by 2022. The NIHR BioResource acquires a case report form at recruitment for each participant recruited on the basis of their disease.  Typically variables include questions that may be used to partition or group patients by their disease course and severity, and include disease history and medication use. This is used to pre-screen or match participants when inviting them to take part in experimental medicine studies.  De-identified versions of this data is available to researchers investigating the feasibility of future studies.Note: Valid metadata in DDI XML format was uploaded to the HDR UK metadata helpdesk.  While an entirely appropriate schema for capturing rich metadata, it could not be readily transformed to meet the Technical Metadata standards, which is (therefore) a poor approximation.",

      "description": "General practice postcode linked measures are available for all practices in CPRD Aurum. The general practice postcode is linked via Lower Super Output Area (LSOA), Super Output Area (SOA) in Northern Ireland and datazone (DZ) in Scotland.\n\nThe general practice postcode linkage includes several well-known area-based measures of deprivation, of which two are available at the LSOA level for linkage to CPRD primary care data through the practice postcode. These measures are: 2015 English Index of Multiple Deprivation (composite and individual domains); 2016 Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (composite and individual domains); 2017 Northern Ireland Index of Multiple Deprivation (composite and individual domains); 2014 Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation (composite and individual domains)\nCarstairs Index: England, Wales and Scotland calculated using 2011 census data.\n\nAs standard, the most recent national Indices of Deprivation are provided for each country. It is important to note that the IMD indices are not comparable between countries in the UK. Older versions of the deprivation scores can be provided on request. The data are updated monthly. Data are provided as quintiles or deciles of the deprivation score to prevent disclosure of patient location. In order to prevent the possibility of deductive disclosure of the location of a practice, researchers will only be provided with one of the above linked datasets for any one study.",

      "description": "Background:\nThe Leeds NIHR Biomarker Research Tissue Bank (RTB) is part of a National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Programme Grants for Applied Research award, focused on biomarker evaluation in selected disease areas.  The RTB was established for the multicentre collection and storage of samples from patients with liver diseases recruited within a randomised controlled trial (ELUCIDATE) of a biomarker panel, renal cancer patients and patients undergoing kidney transplant.\nThe Leeds NIHR Biomarker RTB is jointly managed along with the Multidisciplinary RTB by the Joint RTB Management Committee. The Leeds NIHR Research Tissue Bank (RTB) was given favourable ethical opinion by the Leeds (East) Research Ethics Committee on 15th June 2010 (Current REC ref: 15/YH/0099).  \n\nSample collections:\nOver the duration of the programme, 2,116 participants were recruited in total with 5,976 samples. Sample collection has taken place in multiple centres in the UK. These comprise:\n-\t847 patients with liver disease each with a single serum samples \n-\t514 patients on the kidney transplant waiting list including 312 subsequently transplanted, with 3,806 samples, each sample including multiple aliquots of serum, plasma and urine\n-\t706 patients with suspected renal cancer (200 longitudinal and 506 cross-sectional)  with 1,132 samples, including multiple aliquots of serum, plasma, buffy coat and urine and an FFPE tissue block (frozen available in Leeds patients only)\n-\t149 healthy volunteers with 191 samples, each sample including multiple aliquots of serum, plasma and urine.\nAll samples were collected according to SOPs and have been shipped from the participating sites and stored centrally in Leeds Biobanking and Sample Processing Facility.  Associated clinical data has been collected using standard study-specific case report forms (CRFs), including long-term follow-up in many cases. \nInitially access to samples is prioritised for the needs of the Programme and investigators involved but additional collaborative access will then be possible.

It is dedicated to facilitation of clinical and translational research.\nWe have two main collections: the Peninsula Research Bank (PRB) and the Royal Devon and Exeter Tissue Bank (RDETB). \nThe PRB has ethics to accept gifted samples from completed studies, and the bulk of the collection is from a dedicated biobank collection called EXTEND (the EXeter TEN thousanD), which aims to recruit one in ten of the local Exeter population. The majority (c. 75%) of our studies are local CI led, and we specialise mainly in diabetes, obesity and related pathologies. However, the majority of people within the EXTEND study are fit and well.\nThe RDETB has overarching ethics to collect samples from diagnostic procedures with patients' consent. Each collection within the RDETB uses a standardised consent and collection approach to obtain material that would otherwise be destroyed or not retained. There is scope for prospective studies recruiting through the RDETB.\nBoth collections have a steering committee controlling access, including lay members from within the biobank. There is a standardised approach for requests and the committee sits once a month. In addition, access to gifted samples within the PRB will involve contact with the PI, where possible. Some studies have additional steering committees where they have been carried out in consortia with other centres.\nFirst contact via this directory is encouraged, to establish your needs and our ability to meet them.",

It intends to extend recruitment in all areas, and to other rare and common disease groups, with a target of ~300k by 2022. The NIHR BioResource extracts DNA from blood- and saliva- samples taken at recruitment, and measures a panel of SNPs on each DNA sample, using a commodity SNP genotyping array from e.g. Illumina or Affymetrix (now Thermofisher). This is used to pre-screen or match participants when inviting them to take part in experimental medicine studies.  De-identified versions of this data is available to researchers investigating the feasibility of future studies. The Technical Metadata describes a SNP annotation file \u2013 i.e. what the chip is measuring.  The file itself has as many rows as there are SNPs represented on the chip, and is proprietary to the manufacturer, although deeply familiar to researchers.",
