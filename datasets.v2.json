At the start of this period, the Careers Wales had just been formed from six regional Careers companies, and their CRM system was initially populated with imports from the preceding companies\u2019 systems. Between 2012 and the present Careers Wales has worked to rationalise the varied approaches to recording, enhance the quality and suitability of the data they gather, and to simplify the data entry requirements for their staff as far as possible. Therefore users of the data will very likely notice changes over time in the nature of the data.\n\nCareers Wales stores information on all its interactions, services provided, etc. as entities called histories. Within their CRM, different on-screen fields can be enabled or disabled for different history types \u2013 therefore a history representing a Group Session would contain information on the duration of the session, the topic and the venue; whereas a history for a Traineeship Referral Form completion would not display any of these fields.\n\nAll the numerically coded columns in Careers Wales\u2019 supplied data can be decoded via the accompanying lookup file - HISTORIES_LOOKUP_1545_20200821.CSV.",

Both SGSS and Respiratory DataMart have been adapted and combined to capture detections of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 testing started in UK laboratories on 24 January 2020. This data is reported through a combination of laboratory systems (SGSS and Respiratory DataMart). The majority of testing to date has been offered to those in hospital with a medical need as well as NHS key workers, rather than the general population.

Examples of disciplines are physiotherapy, nursing, pharmacology.\n\nRecording Rules\nThis field should be coded to the Specialty/Discipline of the consultant/GP/HCP who is in charge of the patient episode. If the consultant is formally recognised and contracted to work in more than one specialty then the patients problem or condition should dictate the specialty.\n\nNote that this is the ONLY rule for completing this field. The designation of the beds is not used.\n\nSpecialty/Discipline comprises four characters, the first three of which are allocated by ISD for each specialty, and is mandatory for completion. For the majority of Specialty/Discipline codes, which are two characters, the 3rd character space must be left blank if the 4th character extension is used. The 4th character is an Optional extension of the code for local special interests.\n\nThe Specialty/Discipline code should be entered in the character spaces provided and left justified.\n\nPoints to Note\n\nA separate SMR record is prepared when a patient changes Specialty, Significant Facility or Consultant on medical grounds\nGPs: Patients under the care of a GP in a GP hospital must be given the Specialty code E12 (GP other than Obstetrics) regardless of whether the patients are in a short stay or long stay facility.\nStaff Wards: The Specialty recorded is that of the consultant/GP in charge of the patient. Record Significant Facility as 11 (Other: including all Standard Specialty Wards, Clinical Facility 1K, Day Bed Unit 1J).\nYounger Physically Disabled: Record the Specialty of the consultant in charge of the patient, which will usually be geriatric medicine. Record Significant Facility as 18 (Ward for Younger Physically Disabled) or 1E (Long Stay Unit for Care of the Elderly).\nSee additional notes under Significant Facility.\nFor SMR02 records this should reflect the speciality of the person who was responsible for the care for the mother on original admission.\nExample 1- If the mother was originally admitted under the care of a midwife in an Alongside Midwifery Unit (AMU) or Freestanding Midwifery Unit (FMU), then the midwifery specialty should be recorded in this section, irrespective of whether the mother was then transferred to an Obstetric unit during labour/delivery. When a transfer has occurred Speciality should NOT be attributed to Obstetrics.\n\nExample 2 - If the mother was originally admitted under the care of a Consultant in an Obstetric Unit then the Obstetrics specialty should be recorded here.\n\nCross Checks\n\nSpecialty is checked against Location Code.\nSpecialty is checked against Consultant.\nSpecialty is checked against the Patients Age (at Date of Admission).\nSpecialty is checked against Duration of Stay calculated between Date of Admission and Date of Discharge.\nSpecialty is checked against Record Type\nSpecialty is checked against Significant Facility.\nSMR Validation - Specialty/Discipline\n\n\nRelated items:\n\nHCP Responsible for Care\nLocation Code\nSignificant Facility\nSMR Record Type\nTags:\ndivision  medicine  dentistry  clinical  activity  royal  college  faculties  consultant  GP  HCP  patient  episode  alongside  midwifery  unit  AMU  freestanding  FMU  SMR00  SMR01  SMR02  SMR04",

The term GP practice covers both partnerships and single-handed practices. Each GP practice in Scotland is identified by a unique GP practice code. The practice code is a four-digit code plus a check digit with ranges of codes allocated to each Health Board.\n(Scottish Morbidity Record - NHS Information Services)\n\nRecording Rules\n\nA standard 5 digit numerical code has been developed for the whole of Scotland. It comprises a 4 digit identifying code, which is within an agreed range for each Health Board, and a check digit.\nIt is the Practice Code of the patients registered GP which is recorded in this field\nIt should be noted that the GP Practice code in England is 6 characters long.\nThe General Practice code should be right justified, with the first character a space, unless it is a valid GP Practice Code from outwith Scotland.\nPoints to Note\n\nPractice code will be used to provide information to GMPs on referral activity.\nThe Practice Code on the patients referral or attendance should be record. If a patient changes GP practice between referral and attendance, the new Practice Code should be recorded.\nDummy practice codes are held in the reference files and are hard coded for validation. These codes are:\n99942 - Patients registered with a private practice only\n99957 - Patients not registered with a GP in the UK\n99961 - Patients where practice code is unknown and who are not covered by codes 99942, 99957, 99976, 99981, 99995 and 99961\n99976 - British armed forces patients not registered with a GP in the UK\n99981 - Foreign visitors not registered with a GP in Scotland\n99995 - Patients registered with a GP in England, Wales or Northern Ireland (excluding patients included under code 99942)\nGPPC is not validated for SMR00 or SMR01 records from Dental Hospitals (G106H, S206H, T113H).\nCross Checks\n\nIf it is a Scottish GPPC it must be a valid practice code which is open on the clinic date (SMR00), date of arrival (SMR30) or admission date (all other record types).\nIf it is a practice outwith Scotland it must be a valid code on the \"Rest of UK\" practice reference file.\nFurther Information\nIt should be noted that patients are no longer registered with an individual GP, but with a practice.\n\nIn NHS Scotland, the practice code is a four-digit code plus a check digit with ranges of codes allocated to each Health Board. ISD maintains a GP Practice code reference file which contains up to date details of address, postcode, telephone number for each GP Practice in Scotland.\n\nIn England and Wales, the field is 6 digits therefore to accommodate cross border patient flows, this should be taken into account.\n\nSMR Validation - General Practitioner Practice Code\nTags:\ngeneral  medical  practitioner  services  registered  GMP  SMR00  SMR01  SMR02  SMR04",

This is usually a medical consultant but may be another healthcare professional, for example a midwife, GP, nurse or Allied Healthcare Professional.\n\nPoints to Note\n\nA separate SMR record is submitted when a patient changes Specialty, Significant Facility or Consultant/Health Care Professional Responsible for Care on medical grounds.\nEach hospital will have a list of Consultant/Healthcare Professional Responsible for Care PIN numbers appropriate to the hospital concerned. Where GPs have responsibility for patients a list of GMC numbers of the GPs concerned must be available.\nA Senior Registrar/Registrar/Specialist/Associate Specialists code number must not be used in lieu of the Consultant Code number where the clinical responsibility of care is retained by the Consultant. This may apply where patients only consult with non-consultant grade medical staff and do not see the consultant, for example SAS clinicians. For additional information please refer to this flow chart.\nA nurse/AHPs PIN number must not be used in lieu of the Consultant where the clinical responsibility of the care is retained by the consultant. Where nurses and other AHPs run clinics concurrently or separately, but the responsibility for those clinics rests with the consultant, then the activity must not be recorded on SMR00 for the nurse/AHP. This activity must only be recorded under ISD(S)1 Card Class 7 for AHPs or Card Class 9 for nurses. For additional information please refer to this flow chart.\n\nFurther clarification on points 3&4\n\nA SMR should be attributed to the person who is clinically responsible for care (not just for an outpatient appointment).\nWhere a HCP has determined/prescribed a course of treatment for a patient but has someone else deliver care on their behalf then the SMR should be attributed to the original HCP who would remain clinically responsible for care.\nHowever, when a HCP refers the patient to another specialty for alternative/additional treatment or care then the SMR should be attributed to the new HCP who would then be clinically responsible for the alternative/additional care.\n\nFor example\nIf an Oncologist has prescribed a course of Chemotherapy for a patient but this is delivered by a specialist nurse then the SMR should be attributed to the Consultant. SMR for Oncologist\nIf an Orthopaedic Surgeon considers that the patient needs an orthotic then they would refer them to the Orthotic Team who would then determine best orthotic/treatment plan for the patient. SMR for Orthotics\n\nIt is important to continue recording this data item in this way to allow for comparison/trends across the years.\nA New data item will be introduced in due course to record the Staff Group who delivered Care, e.g. SAS, Specialist Nurse, AHP and this will pick up who is actually seeing the patient.\n\nThese two data items will then complement each other, but measure two types of activity.\n\nIt is the NHS Board responsibility to ensure any new HCP they appoint who meets the definition above is entered in to the National Reference files to ensure records pass validation. This can be done via the eForms process, and must include the date from which the appointment is to be regarded as effective, together with the specialty/discipline or specialties/disciplines in which the HCP may work. When a HCP retires, dies or moves elsewhere, the effective end date should also be amended on the system.

The General Dental Council Number consists of D + 6 numberic.\n\nThe 8 digit personal identification number (PIN) allocated to other healthcare professionals (e.g. midwives) is used as the HCP code. In the case of a midwife the PIN consists of an 8 character alpha/numeric code, although this format may differ for other HCPs (e.g. Podiatrists).\n\nRecording GMC/GDC/PIN\nThe code number of the HCP who had clinical responsibility for the patient during the episode should be right justified in the character spaces provided.\n\nCross Checks\n\nConsultant GMC/HCP number must be present on the appropriate reference file.

The appropriate admission category depends on the clinical condition of the patient as assessed by the receiving consultant. The patient may or may not be on a waiting list.\n\nNotes\n\nRoutine Admission\nA routine admission occurs when a patient is admitted as planned.\n\nUrgent Admission\nAn urgent admission is a type of emergency admission where the admission is delayed for hospital/patient reasons and the patients condition is such that he/she is not clinically compromised or disadvantaged by the short delay.\n\nAn example of an urgent admission is a patient who attends for an outpatient appointment at which the doctor decides there is a clinical need to admit the patient within the next few days.\n\nNote 1: If the patient is not already on a waiting list, he/she is NOT placed on one for the duration of the delay. Urgent admissions from a waiting list can be identified from the patients Waiting List Type code.\n\nEmergency Admission\nAn emergency admission occurs when, for clinical reasons, a patient is admitted at the earliest possible time after seeing a doctor.\n\nNote 1: The patient may or may not be admitted through Accident & Emergency.\nNote 2: Emergency admissions from a waiting list can be identified from the patients Waiting List Type code\n\nOther Admission\nOther admission is a type of admission which is neither emergency, urgent, routine nor pertains to Maternity or Neonatal admissions, e.g. a patient who is admitted from an outpatient clinic, not for clinical need but because a bed is available.\n\nPoints to Note\n\nRoutine Admission (Code 10)\nThis code should be used for patients being admitted for respite care and for patients routinely re-admitted having exceeded their pass period.\nRoutine Admission: Patient, not on waiting list, admitted on same day (Code 12)If the patient is not already on a waiting list, s/he must be placed on one with a Waiting List Date recorded as the date the decision is made to admit the patient.\nEmergency - deliberate self inflicted injury or poisoning (Code 31)This code should be used ONLY IF THE CASE NOTES HAVE SPECIFIED injury or poisoning as self-inflicted; otherwise the appropriate code should be 33 or 35.\nThe use of codes 19 and 39 will always be queried.\nCodes 40 & 48 are not valid on SMR01.\nEmergency - Road Traffic Accident (Code 32)\nIn strict terms, \"Road Traffic Accident\" is one that involves one or more vehicles on the public highway. However, for SMR01 a looser definition is used, to include not only accidents involving vehicles (cars, buses, motor bikes, etc.) but also pedal bicycles and horses, provided the accident takes place on the public highway.\nEmergency - Home Incident (includes accidental poisoning) (Code 33)\nThis code should be used for any accident, injury or poisoning that takes place in the patients own home or the garden or grounds of that home, provided that there was no intention (determined by medical staff) on the part of the patient to injure or kill himself. This code should also be used when a patient has been the victim of an assault in the home.\nEmergency - Work Incident (includes accidental poisoning) (Code 34)\nThis code should be used for any accident, injury or poisoning that takes place in the patients work place, provided that there was no intention (determined by medical staff) on the part of the patient to injure or kill himself. This code should also be used when a patient has been the victim of an assault in the work place.\nEmergency - Other Injury (includes accidental poisoning) (Code 35)\nThis code should be used for any accident, injury, assault or poisoning that takes place other than in the patients own home or workplace (see notes 7 & 8) provided that there was no intention (determined by medical staff) on the part of the patient to injure or kill himself. This code should also be used for incidents occurring in residential homes.\n\nExample 1\nAn accidental fall from the window of the patients home or jumping from the window to escape a fire would be given Admission Type Code 33, while jumping from the same window intending to commit suicide would be given Admission Type Code 31.\n\nExample 2\nA child drinking, for example, weed killer or bleach, thinking it was lemonade, or taking pills thinking they were sweets, would be given Admission Type Code 33. A patient taking an excessive amount of normal drug in the belief that this might be more beneficial than the stated dose would also be given Admission Type Code 33. However, a patient who takes an overdose of drugs with the intention of suicide, or even as a \"cry for help\", should be given Admission Type Code 31.\n\nExample 3\nA patient is admitted from home with cuts to both wrists. There is no indication in the case notes that the injuries were deliberately self-inflicted, i.e. that the patient intended to harm himself. The case is therefore given Admission Type Code 33.\n\nExample 4\nA patient admitted following an assault which took place in the home should be given Admission Type Code 33.\n\nPatient Non-Injury (Code 36)\nThis code is to be used for emergencies which are not accidents, injuries or poisonings, whenever they occur. Examples are myocardial infarction, acute asthma, ruptured appendix, or post-operative complications.\nOther Emergency Admission (Code 38)\nAn example of the use of this code is an emergency admission for respite care and a patient awaiting routine admission whose condition deteriorates.\nCross Checks\n\nAdmission Type is cross-checked against Management of Patient codes, e.g. Day Cases cannot be emergency admissions.\nSMR01 - Admission Type is cross-checked against Admission Reason (when present).\nAdmission Type is cross-checked against Record Type.\nAdmission Type is cross-checked against Waiting List Type.\nCodes and Values: Admission Type (Code order)\n\nEmergency Admission\n30 - Emergency Admission, no additional detail added\n31 - Patient Injury - Self Inflicted (Injury or Poisoning)\n32 - Patient Injury - Road Traffic Accident (RTA)\n33 - Patient Injury - Home Incident (including Assault or Accidental Poisoning in the home)\n34 - Patient Injury - Incident at Work (including Assault or Accidental Poisoning at work)\n35 - Patient Injury - Other Injury (inc.

Each GP practice uses a clinical information system to maintain an electronic health record for each of their patients; capturing the signs, symptoms, test results, diagnoses, prescribed treatment, referrals for specialist treatment and social aspects relating to the patients home environment.\n\n\nThe majority of the data is entered by the clinician during the patient consultation. Test results are electronically transferred from secondary care systems.\n\nThere are no standard rules for recording data within primary care clinical information systems. Therefore, each individual clinician can record information in their own way. The majority use Read Code Terminology, however, sometimes this is applied behind the scenes by the clinical system and sometimes local codes are used. Read codes are not as precise as ICD 10 or OPCS codes.\n\nCoding standards have been agreed on for conditions monitored by the QOF (Quality Outcomes Framework) returns. Since the implementation of QOF these conditions have been coded in a more consistent way.\n\nTime coverage varies between each practice.",

The first collection was introduced in 2019 and collects information at November each year.\n\nThe SWAC is split into two parts: SWAC School return and SWAC Pay, HR and absences return.\n\nThe SWAC School return is completed by all local authority maintained school settings in Wales, including Pupil Referral Units (PRUs). Schools record data on the workforce throughout the year in their Management Information System (MIS) software. This part of the return collects information on workforce characteristics (including Welsh language, ethnicity and disability), staff roles and curriculum taught.\n\nThe SWAC Pay, HR and Absences return is completed by each local authority, as well as schools which have opted-out of payroll and / or human resource (HR) service level agreements with their local authority. The data is maintained throughout the year in their HR and payroll systems. This return collects information on staff contracts, including salary and any additional payments they receive. This approach ensures that data for all relevant staff who work at local authority maintained schools is captured.",

The CMO for Wales commissioned a collaboration of national bodies in Wales (NWIS, DU, NWSSP, PHW) to identify \u201chigh risk\u201d people for the Welsh population, based largely on the NHS Digital methodology. This list is referred to as the Shielded Patient List (SPL). \n\nThe \u201chigh risk\u201d list was defined as a subset of a wider group of people who may be \u201cat risk\u201d. Specific advice applies to these groups, currently this advice is:\n \u2022 \u201cAt Risk\u201d \u2013 large group normally at risk from the flu - should practice strict social distancing \n\u2022 \u201cAt high risk\u201d \u2013 a smaller sub-group (circa 70k), defined by CMO \u2013 should practice complete social \u201cshielding\u201d NHS Digital have described the methodology that has been used to identify patients who meet the high risk criteria due to their inclusion in one or more of the disease groups. \n\nAs there are differences in some of the systems used across the devolved nations, nuanced differences in application and interpretation of CMO guidance, this document describes the Welsh methodology.\n\nhttps://nwis.nhs.wales/coronavirus/coronavirus-content/coronavirus-documents/covid-19-high-risk-shielded-patient-list-identification-methodology/",

To aid in user needs, timely but provisional counts of death registrations in England and Wales are pubilshed weekly, monthly, and quarterly. Annual mortality statistics (based on deaths registered in a calendar year) are published in separate packages to enable the timely release of statistics. From 1974 to 2005, mortality statistics were published in the annual reference volumns, DH1, DH2, and DH4. From 1993 to 2005, figures were based on deaths occurring annually in England and Wales in the reference year. Prior to 1993, figures were based on deaths registered in England and Wales in the reference year. In 2006, these three volumes were replaced by a single publication, Mortality statistics: deaths registered in England and Wales (Series DR) based on deaths registered in a reference year.",

It is possible to have more than one nature of injury code for a single death. This covers all records where the underlying cause of death is an external cause from 2001 onwards [using ICD-10 coding ONLY], and from 1993-2000 [using ICD-9 coding ONLY]. Sometimes information on injuries is derived from coroner forms that are supplied to ONS, in particular coroner certificates of cause of death after inquest. NOTE - Because the revised form no longer includes specific questions about type of injury and parts of body injured, some coroners now often provide less detail than before. The result is that some deaths are assigned to residual codes for nature of injury. For example, in ICD-10 the statement \u201chead injury\u201d is coded to \u201cunspecified injury of head\u201d (S09.9), whereas with more detail it might be assigned to \u201cfracture of skull and facial bones\u201d (S02.n). The move from ICD-9 to ICD-10 had an impact on the allocation of secondary causes. ONS published an assessment of this impact (Griffiths and Rooney 2003). In ICD-10, when more than one body region is involved, coding is made to the relevant category of injuries involving multiple body regions (T00\u2013T07). Therefore, in the above example of an occupant injured in a transport accident, under ICD-10 the secondary cause would be classified as \u201cother specified injuries involving multiple body regions\u201d (T06.8), whereas under ICD-9 the secondary cause would be more specifically classified as a fracture of the skull (ICD-9 800).

        "description": "Every ten years since 1801 the nation has set aside one day for the census - a count of all people and households. It is the most complete source of information about the population that we have. The latest census was held on Sunday 27 March 2011.\n\nEvery effort is made to include everyone, and that is why the census is so important. It is the only survey which provides a detailed picture of the entire population, and is unique because it covers everyone at the same time and asks the same core questions everywhere. This makes it easy to compare different parts of the country.\n\nThe information the census provides allows central and local government, health authorities and many other organisations to target their resources more effectively and to plan housing, education, health and transport services for years to come.\n\nIn England and Wales, the census is planned and carried out by the Office for National Statistics. Elsewhere in the UK, responsibility lies with the National Records of Scotland and the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency.",

For a minority of cases there is a short lag (usually no more than 3 months) between birth and the baby CHI number being fed through into the national CHI database. An example would be a home birth or a birth in a remote community. Often there is no immediate CHI-allocation/registration facility available in such circumstances.\nOnce the CHI number becomes available on the Master Patient Record it is important that these numbers should be added to all SMR returns.

The abnormal presentation may be persistent occipito posterior (POP).\nIf \u2018low\u2019, \u2018mid\u2019 or \u2018high\u2019 cavity is mentioned, this should take priority over the type of forceps.\nCode 2 - should be used when forceps are specified, but no further information is provided (i.e. forceps NOS.); also for Wrigley\u2019s Forceps, where no note of the position of the forceps is available.

Although Condition on Discharge (code 3) and Number of Births (>0) are used to determine whether a delivery has occurred, outcome of pregnancy further determines whether or not the record of baby data items may, must or must not be present.\nThese rules apply to Baby 1, 2, 3 where appropriate.\nCodes and Values: Outcome of Pregnancy (Code order)\n1 Livebirth\n2 Stillbirth\n3 Livebirth dying within the first 6 days (early neonatal death).\n4 Livebirth dying on or after the 7th completed day but before the 28th day (late neonatal eath).\n5 Livebirth dying on or after the 28th completed day, but before the end of the first year of life (post-neonatal death).\n8 Abortion of a dead fetus of a multiple pregnancy ending before 24 wks of gestation in which the other babies are live born.\n\nSMR Validation - Outcome of Pregnancy\n\n\nRelated items:\n\nBaby Discharged To - Babies 1 to 3\nCondition on Discharge\nEstimated Gestation\nNumber of Births this Pregnancy\nTags:\nbaby  liveborn  stillborn  aborted  recording  code  born  dies  SMR02",

Examples of disciplines are physiotherapy, nursing, pharmacology.\n\nRecording Rules\nThis field should be coded to the Specialty/Discipline of the consultant/GP/HCP who is in charge of the patient episode. If the consultant is formally recognised and contracted to work in more than one specialty then the patients problem or condition should dictate the specialty.\n\nNote that this is the ONLY rule for completing this field. The designation of the beds is not used.\n\nSpecialty/Discipline comprises four characters, the first three of which are allocated by ISD for each specialty, and is mandatory for completion. For the majority of Specialty/Discipline codes, which are two characters, the 3rd character space must be left blank if the 4th character extension is used. The 4th character is an Optional extension of the code for local special interests.\n\nThe Specialty/Discipline code should be entered in the character spaces provided and left justified.\n\nPoints to Note\n\nA separate SMR record is prepared when a patient changes Specialty, Significant Facility or Consultant on medical grounds\nGPs: Patients under the care of a GP in a GP hospital must be given the Specialty code E12 (GP other than Obstetrics) regardless of whether the patients are in a short stay or long stay facility.\nStaff Wards: The Specialty recorded is that of the consultant/GP in charge of the patient. Record Significant Facility as 11 (Other: including all Standard Specialty Wards, Clinical Facility 1K, Day Bed Unit 1J).\nYounger Physically Disabled: Record the Specialty of the consultant in charge of the patient, which will usually be geriatric medicine. Record Significant Facility as 18 (Ward for Younger Physically Disabled) or 1E (Long Stay Unit for Care of the Elderly).\nSee additional notes under Significant Facility.\nFor SMR02 records this should reflect the speciality of the person who was responsible for the care for the mother on original admission.\nExample 1- If the mother was originally admitted under the care of a midwife in an Alongside Midwifery Unit (AMU) or Freestanding Midwifery Unit (FMU), then the midwifery specialty should be recorded in this section, irrespective of whether the mother was then transferred to an Obstetric unit during labour/delivery. When a transfer has occurred Speciality should NOT be attributed to Obstetrics.\n\nExample 2 - If the mother was originally admitted under the care of a Consultant in an Obstetric Unit then the Obstetrics specialty should be recorded here.\n\nCross Checks\n\nSpecialty is checked against Location Code.\nSpecialty is checked against Consultant.\nSpecialty is checked against the Patients Age (at Date of Admission).\nSpecialty is checked against Duration of Stay calculated between Date of Admission and Date of Discharge.\nSpecialty is checked against Record Type\nSpecialty is checked against Significant Facility.\nSMR Validation - Specialty/Discipline\n\n\nRelated items:\n\nHCP Responsible for Care\nLocation Code\nSignificant Facility\nSMR Record Type\nTags:\ndivision  medicine  dentistry  clinical  activity  royal  college  faculties  consultant  GP  HCP  patient  episode  alongside  midwifery  unit  AMU  freestanding  FMU  SMR00  SMR01  SMR02  SMR04",

If a patient changes GP practice between referral and attendance, the new Practice Code should be recorded.\nDummy practice codes are held in the reference files and are hard coded for validation.

Examples of disciplines are physiotherapy, nursing, pharmacology.\n\nRecording Rules\nThis field should be coded to the Specialty/Discipline of the consultant/GP/HCP who is in charge of the patient episode. If the consultant is formally recognised and contracted to work in more than one specialty then the patients problem or condition should dictate the specialty.\n\nNote that this is the ONLY rule for completing this field. The designation of the beds is not used.\n\nSpecialty/Discipline comprises four characters, the first three of which are allocated by ISD for each specialty, and is mandatory for completion. For the majority of Specialty/Discipline codes, which are two characters, the 3rd character space must be left blank if the 4th character extension is used. The 4th character is an Optional extension of the code for local special interests.\n\nThe Specialty/Discipline code should be entered in the character spaces provided and left justified.\n\nPoints to Note\n\nA separate SMR record is prepared when a patient changes Specialty, Significant Facility or Consultant on medical grounds\nGPs: Patients under the care of a GP in a GP hospital must be given the Specialty code E12 (GP other than Obstetrics) regardless of whether the patients are in a short stay or long stay facility.\nStaff Wards: The Specialty recorded is that of the consultant/GP in charge of the patient. Record Significant Facility as 11 (Other: including all Standard Specialty Wards, Clinical Facility 1K, Day Bed Unit 1J).\nYounger Physically Disabled: Record the Specialty of the consultant in charge of the patient, which will usually be geriatric medicine. Record Significant Facility as 18 (Ward for Younger Physically Disabled) or 1E (Long Stay Unit for Care of the Elderly).\nSee additional notes under Significant Facility.\nFor SMR02 records this should reflect the speciality of the person who was responsible for the care for the mother on original admission.\nExample 1- If the mother was originally admitted under the care of a midwife in an Alongside Midwifery Unit (AMU) or Freestanding Midwifery Unit (FMU), then the midwifery specialty should be recorded in this section, irrespective of whether the mother was then transferred to an Obstetric unit during labour/delivery. When a transfer has occurred Speciality should NOT be attributed to Obstetrics.\n\nExample 2 - If the mother was originally admitted under the care of a Consultant in an Obstetric Unit then the Obstetrics specialty should be recorded here.\n\nCross Checks\n\nSpecialty is checked against Location Code.\nSpecialty is checked against Consultant.\nSpecialty is checked against the Patients Age (at Date of Admission).\nSpecialty is checked against Duration of Stay calculated between Date of Admission and Date of Discharge.\nSpecialty is checked against Record Type\nSpecialty is checked against Significant Facility.\nSMR Validation - Specialty/Discipline\n\n\nRelated items:\n\nHCP Responsible for Care\nLocation Code\nSignificant Facility\nSMR Record Type\nTags:\ndivision  medicine  dentistry  clinical  activity  royal  college  faculties  consultant  GP  HCP  patient  episode  alongside  midwifery  unit  AMU  freestanding  FMU  SMR00  SMR01  SMR02  SMR04",

The appropriate admission category depends on the clinical condition of the patient as assessed by the receiving consultant. The patient may or may not be on a waiting list.\n\nNotes\n\nRoutine Admission\nA routine admission occurs when a patient is admitted as planned.\n\nUrgent Admission\nAn urgent admission is a type of emergency admission where the admission is delayed for hospital/patient reasons and the patients condition is such that he/she is not clinically compromised or disadvantaged by the short delay.\n\nAn example of an urgent admission is a patient who attends for an outpatient appointment at which the doctor decides there is a clinical need to admit the patient within the next few days.\n\nNote 1: If the patient is not already on a waiting list, he/she is NOT placed on one for the duration of the delay. Urgent admissions from a waiting list can be identified from the patients Waiting List Type code.\n\nEmergency Admission\nAn emergency admission occurs when, for clinical reasons, a patient is admitted at the earliest possible time after seeing a doctor.\n\nNote 1: The patient may or may not be admitted through Accident & Emergency.\nNote 2: Emergency admissions from a waiting list can be identified from the patients Waiting List Type code\n\nOther Admission\nOther admission is a type of admission which is neither emergency, urgent, routine nor pertains to Maternity or Neonatal admissions, e.g. a patient who is admitted from an outpatient clinic, not for clinical need but because a bed is available.\n\nPoints to Note\n\nRoutine Admission (Code 10)\nThis code should be used for patients being admitted for respite care and for patients routinely re-admitted having exceeded their pass period.\nRoutine Admission: Patient, not on waiting list, admitted on same day (Code 12)If the patient is not already on a waiting list, s/he must be placed on one with a Waiting List Date recorded as the date the decision is made to admit the patient.\nEmergency - deliberate self inflicted injury or poisoning (Code 31)This code should be used ONLY IF THE CASE NOTES HAVE SPECIFIED injury or poisoning as self-inflicted; otherwise the appropriate code should be 33 or 35.\nThe use of codes 19 and 39 will always be queried.\nCodes 40 & 48 are not valid on SMR01.\nEmergency - Road Traffic Accident (Code 32)\nIn strict terms, \"Road Traffic Accident\" is one that involves one or more vehicles on the public highway. However, for SMR01 a looser definition is used, to include not only accidents involving vehicles (cars, buses, motor bikes, etc.) but also pedal bicycles and horses, provided the accident takes place on the public highway.\nEmergency - Home Incident (includes accidental poisoning) (Code 33)\nThis code should be used for any accident, injury or poisoning that takes place in the patients own home or the garden or grounds of that home, provided that there was no intention (determined by medical staff) on the part of the patient to injure or kill himself. This code should also be used when a patient has been the victim of an assault in the home.\nEmergency - Work Incident (includes accidental poisoning) (Code 34)\nThis code should be used for any accident, injury or poisoning that takes place in the patients work place, provided that there was no intention (determined by medical staff) on the part of the patient to injure or kill himself. This code should also be used when a patient has been the victim of an assault in the work place.\nEmergency - Other Injury (includes accidental poisoning) (Code 35)\nThis code should be used for any accident, injury, assault or poisoning that takes place other than in the patients own home or workplace (see notes 7 & 8) provided that there was no intention (determined by medical staff) on the part of the patient to injure or kill himself. This code should also be used for incidents occurring in residential homes.\n\nExample 1\nAn accidental fall from the window of the patients home or jumping from the window to escape a fire would be given Admission Type Code 33, while jumping from the same window intending to commit suicide would be given Admission Type Code 31.\n\nExample 2\nA child drinking, for example, weed killer or bleach, thinking it was lemonade, or taking pills thinking they were sweets, would be given Admission Type Code 33. A patient taking an excessive amount of normal drug in the belief that this might be more beneficial than the stated dose would also be given Admission Type Code 33. However, a patient who takes an overdose of drugs with the intention of suicide, or even as a \"cry for help\", should be given Admission Type Code 31.\n\nExample 3\nA patient is admitted from home with cuts to both wrists. There is no indication in the case notes that the injuries were deliberately self-inflicted, i.e. that the patient intended to harm himself. The case is therefore given Admission Type Code 33.\n\nExample 4\nA patient admitted following an assault which took place in the home should be given Admission Type Code 33.\n\nPatient Non-Injury (Code 36)\nThis code is to be used for emergencies which are not accidents, injuries or poisonings, whenever they occur. Examples are myocardial infarction, acute asthma, ruptured appendix, or post-operative complications.\nOther Emergency Admission (Code 38)\nAn example of the use of this code is an emergency admission for respite care and a patient awaiting routine admission whose condition deteriorates.\nCross Checks\n\nAdmission Type is cross-checked against Management of Patient codes, e.g. Day Cases cannot be emergency admissions.\nSMR01 - Admission Type is cross-checked against Admission Reason (when present).\nAdmission Type is cross-checked against Record Type.\nAdmission Type is cross-checked against Waiting List Type.\nCodes and Values: Admission Type (Code order)\n\nEmergency Admission\n30 - Emergency Admission, no additional detail added\n31 - Patient Injury - Self Inflicted (Injury or Poisoning)\n32 - Patient Injury - Road Traffic Accident (RTA)\n33 - Patient Injury - Home Incident (including Assault or Accidental Poisoning in the home)\n34 - Patient Injury - Incident at Work (including Assault or Accidental Poisoning at work)\n35 - Patient Injury - Other Injury (inc.

This is usually a medical consultant but may be another healthcare professional, for example a midwife, GP, nurse or Allied Healthcare Professional.\n\nPoints to Note\n\nA separate SMR record is submitted when a patient changes Specialty, Significant Facility or Consultant/Health Care Professional Responsible for Care on medical grounds.\nEach hospital will have a list of Consultant/Healthcare Professional Responsible for Care PIN numbers appropriate to the hospital concerned. Where GPs have responsibility for patients a list of GMC numbers of the GPs concerned must be available.\nA Senior Registrar/Registrar/Specialist/Associate Specialists code number must not be used in lieu of the Consultant Code number where the clinical responsibility of care is retained by the Consultant. This may apply where patients only consult with non-consultant grade medical staff and do not see the consultant, for example SAS clinicians. For additional information please refer to this flow chart.\nA nurse/AHPs PIN number must not be used in lieu of the Consultant where the clinical responsibility of the care is retained by the consultant. Where nurses and other AHPs run clinics concurrently or separately, but the responsibility for those clinics rests with the consultant, then the activity must not be recorded on SMR00 for the nurse/AHP. This activity must only be recorded under ISD(S)1 Card Class 7 for AHPs or Card Class 9 for nurses. For additional information please refer to this flow chart.\n\nFurther clarification on points 3&4\n\nA SMR should be attributed to the person who is clinically responsible for care (not just for an outpatient appointment).\nWhere a HCP has determined/prescribed a course of treatment for a patient but has someone else deliver care on their behalf then the SMR should be attributed to the original HCP who would remain clinically responsible for care.\nHowever, when a HCP refers the patient to another specialty for alternative/additional treatment or care then the SMR should be attributed to the new HCP who would then be clinically responsible for the alternative/additional care.\n\nFor example\nIf an Oncologist has prescribed a course of Chemotherapy for a patient but this is delivered by a specialist nurse then the SMR should be attributed to the Consultant. SMR for Oncologist\nIf an Orthopaedic Surgeon considers that the patient needs an orthotic then they would refer them to the Orthotic Team who would then determine best orthotic/treatment plan for the patient. SMR for Orthotics\n\nIt is important to continue recording this data item in this way to allow for comparison/trends across the years.\nA New data item will be introduced in due course to record the Staff Group who delivered Care, e.g. SAS, Specialist Nurse, AHP and this will pick up who is actually seeing the patient.\n\nThese two data items will then complement each other, but measure two types of activity.\n\nIt is the NHS Board responsibility to ensure any new HCP they appoint who meets the definition above is entered in to the National Reference files to ensure records pass validation. This can be done via the eForms process, and must include the date from which the appointment is to be regarded as effective, together with the specialty/discipline or specialties/disciplines in which the HCP may work. When a HCP retires, dies or moves elsewhere, the effective end date should also be amended on the system. Details of how the add HCPs to the reference files can be found here.\nSMR00s must not be completed:-\n- Where a Midwifery clinic is overseen by an obstetrician\n- Where a nurse is carrying out routine nursing work such as bloods, dressings etc\nFor SMR02 records this should reflect the person who was responsible for the care of the mother on original admission to the unit.\nExample 1 - If the mother was originally admitted under the care of a midwife in an Alongside Midwifery Unit (AMU) or Freestanding Midwifery Unit (FMU), then the midwife should be recorded in this section, irrespective if the mother was then transferred during her care episode.\nExample 2 - If the mother was originally admitted to an Obstetric Unit then the Consultant initially responsible for her care should be recorded here, irrespective of whether care was primarily provided by midwifery staff.\nRecording Rules\n\nIt is the Hospitals responsibility to register individuals on the National Reference Files that meet the definition of Consultant/HCP Responsible for Care as above.\n\nThe 7 digit General Medical Council (GMC) Number allocated to each doctor is used as the consultant code. The General Dental Council Number consists of D + 6 numberic.\n\nThe 8 digit personal identification number (PIN) allocated to other healthcare professionals (e.g. midwives) is used as the HCP code. In the case of a midwife the PIN consists of an 8 character alpha/numeric code, although this format may differ for other HCPs (e.g. Podiatrists).\n\nRecording GMC/GDC/PIN\nThe code number of the HCP who had clinical responsibility for the patient during the episode should be right justified in the character spaces provided.\n\nCross Checks\n\nConsultant GMC/HCP number must be present on the appropriate reference file. It is important that additions and changes are notified to ISD as soon as possible. Request Forms for updating of the Consultant/HCP reference files can be found here .\nThe GMC/HCP number must be on the reference file at clinic date (record type SMR00) or Admission Date (record type SMR01, 02 and 04).\nIf the record type is SMR02 and an 8 digit HCP code is used, Specialty/Discipline must be T2 or T21 (midwife).\nSMR Validation - HCP Responsible for Care\n\nRelated terms: Healthcare professional\n\nTags:\nprofessional  healthcare  episode  consultant  nurse  AHP  midwife  GP  GMC  SMR00  SMR01  SMR02  SMR04",

A patient who continues to occupy a hospital bed after his/her ready-for-discharge date during the SAME inpatient episode experiences a delayed discharge.\n\nRecording Rules\nThe full date should be entered thus:\n2 August 2004 =\n\n0\t2\t0\t8\t0\t4\nNotes\n\n\u201cA more appropriate care setting\u201d covers all appropriate destinations outwith short-stay specialties and outwith the NHS (patient\u2019s home, nursing home etc).\nFrom a service provider\u2019s perspective an \u201cappropriate care setting\u201d can be defined as a place that:\n\nMeets the particular care needs of a person.\nMeets those needs cost effectively.\n\nIf a patient who is clinically ready for discharge is being transferred for non-clinical reasons to another NHS facility whilst awaiting final discharge (which will result in the start of another NHS episode) i.e. to free up short-stay beds, the original Ready for Discharge date should be recorded.\nPoints to Note\n\nThis item is a core criterion of the national standard definition of delayed discharge contained in MEL(2000)07. It can be used to measure duration of delay by looking at the time elapsed between \"Ready for Discharge Date\" and the actual date of discharge.\nICD10 codes can be used in the clinical section to indicate reason for delay in discharge, e.g. living alone - Z60.2.\nSMR02 - Mother staying in hospital because baby is in Neonatal Unit. An SMR02 should be completed to cover the entire episode. Complete Ready for Discharge Date and routine clinical coding for the delivery episode. In addition, use Z39.2 (routine postpartum follow-up) and Z76.3 (healthy person accompanying sick person) to indicate the reasons for delayed discharge. If the mother returns to hospital to be with a sick baby more than 10 days after the delivery, she is a nonpatient and no SMR02 should be completed.\nCross Checks\n\nReady for Discharge Date is checked to be in sequence with other dates.\nReady for Discharge Date must not be present for all types of day cases.\nSMR Validation - Ready for Discharge Date\n\n\nRelated items:\n\nDelayed Discharge\nDischarge\nDischarge Date\nInpatient\nInpatient Episode\nTags:\ninpatient  responsible  consultant  multi-discipline  team  MDT  episode  GP  agencies  patient  transfer  hospital  bed  duration  of  delay  SMR01  SMR02  SMR04  appropriate  care  setting",

        "description": "Public Health England\u2019s National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS), one of the largest, most advanced and complex cancer data curation service anywhere in the world, collects data on all cases of cancer that occur in people living in England. NCRAS routinely collects both patient and tumour level information to build a rich picture of the cancer patient pathway, through the Cancer Outcomes and Services Dataset (COSD). \n\nNCRAS merges data from multiple datasets to create the National Cancer Registration Dataset, which is then enhanced with data from other sources by linking at either a patient or tumour level, including data from:\n\u2022\tRadiotherapy Dataset (RTDS), \n\u2022\tSystemic Anti-Cancer Therapy Dataset (SACT), \n\u2022\tNational Cancer Diagnosis Audit (NCDA), \n\u2022\tNational Clinical Audits for Lung, Breast and Prostate Cancer\n\u2022\tNational Head and Neck Cancer Audit\n\u2022\tHES (inpatient, outpatient and A&E),\n\u2022\tDiagnostic Imaging Dataset (DID)\n\u2022\tNational Cancer Waiting Times (CWT) Monitoring dataset\n\u2022\tNational Cancer Patient Experience Survey (CPES) dataset\n\u2022\tPatient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) data collections\n\nNational Cancer Registration Dataset: This dataset contains three types of tables for patient information, tumour information and treatment information, which are linked by NHS number. The national cancer registration dataset includes a subset of COSD, as well as the Route to Diagnosis for each tumour, Charlson co-morbidity, and information from the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD). Further information is given in the \u2018Data Resource Profile: National Cancer Registration Dataset\u2019: https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/49/1/16/5476570 \n\nSystemic Anti Cancer Therapy (SACT) dataset:  Since April 2012 NCRAS has collected data on systemic anti-cancer therapy (SACT) activities, which includes chemotherapy, from all NHS England chemotherapy providers to create the SACT dataset. The SACT dataset collects clinical information about treatments given to patients. Further information is given in the \u2018Data Resource Profile: The Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy (SACT) dataset\u2019: https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/49/1/15/5538002 \n\nRadiotherapy dataset (RTDS): Introduced in 2009, the Radiotherapy Dataset (RTDS) is the national data standard for collecting information about radiotherapy treatment. The RTDS collects data from all NHS Acute Trust providers of radiotherapy services in England, who submit data to NCRAS monthly.\n\nNational Cancer Diagnosis Audit (NCDA): NCRAS collects and manages data for the National Cancer Diagnosis Audit, which contains information about the diagnosis of cancer patients in primary and secondary care. Participating GPs securely submit information about the primary care part of the pathway for their patients who were diagnosed with cancer during the timeframe selected for the audit.\n\nNational Clinical Audits for Lung, Breast and Prostate Cancer: NCRAS manages the data collection for the National Lung Cancer Audit, the National Prostate Cancer Audit and the National Audit for Breast Cancer in Older Patients.\n\nHospital Episodes Statistics (HES): The Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) dataset is collected and managed by NHS Digital and contains administrative data on hospital admissions within the NHS. This includes inpatient, outpatient and A&E attendances and appointments. It is used by the NHS to allow hospitals to be paid for the care they deliver.\n\nDiagnostic Imaging Dataset (DID): The Diagnostic Imaging Dataset (DID) collected by NHS Digital contains information on diagnostic imaging tests carried out by the NHS. It includes details about the type of test used, where on the body it was conducted, the source of referral as well as patient demographic information.\n\nNational Cancer Waiting Times (CWT) Monitoring data: The National Cancer Waiting Times (CWT) Monitoring dataset from NHS England includes data on the time between referral, diagnosis and treatment for cancer patients in the NHS. It is used to support the cancer waiting times standards between different points of the cancer pathway.\n\nNational Cancer Patient Experience Survey (CPES): Commissioned by NHS England, the National Cancer Patient Experience Survey (CPES) dataset is based on surveys sent to patients asking about their cancer journey from symptoms, diagnosis and treatment to aftercare.\n\nNational Head and Neck Cancer Audit: Managed by NHS Digital, the National Head and Neck Cancer Audit collected data from hospitals in England and Wales on the diagnosis and treatment of patients with cancer of the head and neck, covering patients diagnosed up to 2014.\n\nPatient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) datasets: Data from Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) data collections are held by NCRAS. PROMs surveys collect data from patients about their experience of their journey from diagnosis to aftercare. The data provides a snapshot of patient reported outcomes at specific points in time when the surveys were conducted and are not measured and collected routinely by NCRAS. Datasets held by NCRAS include bladder, breast, colorectal, gynaecological, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and prostate cancer snapshots.\n\nFor more details on the coverage and availability of each of these individual datasets, please see information available at https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-cancer-registration-and-analysis-service-ncras#guides-to-cancer-data-and-working-with-us and on the \u201cTechnical details\u201d tab above.",

Data were collected on 17,042 cancer cases in England and 2,014 cases in Scotland. \n\nTwo datasets are available: 1. English only data which can be linked to the cancer registry (n=17,042) and 2. a standalone dataset containing English and Scottish data (n=19,056).\n\nThe NCDA cohort was created by selecting all malignant cancer cases (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) diagnosed in 2014, as registered by NCRAS (England) or ISD Scotland. Participation on the NCDA was optional and verified GPs entered primary care information on patients registered at their practice whilst diagnosed with cancer. For the English NCDA, data were not entered on patients whose cancer was detected through screening but the data has been retained in the dataset for completeness. Information on screen-detected cancers was collected in the Scottish NCDA.\n\nThe audit in England was conducted between Sept 2016 and Feb 2017 and 439 practices (about 5% of all practices) submitted data. Of the practices that participated, 365 practices entered data on ?95% of patients from the audit list. The NCDA represents 6% of the total cancers registered in 2014 and the distribution of age and cancer types were similar to the total cohort of cancers registered in 2014. The participating practices were similar to non-participating practices, with respect to age, urban/rural location and practice -based patient experience measures, however practices participating in the NCDA were somewhat larger and had slightly fewer patients per GP (Swann et al. BJGP 2018 68(666):e63-e66 doi:10.3399/bjgp17X694169).\n\nFor the Scottish NCDA, 73 practices participated (about 8% of all practices in Scotland) and entered data between Jan 2017 and May 2017 (Murchie et al. Eur J Cancer Care 2020 29(3):e13234. doi: 10.1111/ecc.13234).\n\nWhere NCDA data are requested, NCRAS will, by default, mask the GP practice name, unless the data are requested from the GP practice itself.",

It relates to all cancer patients, both adult and paediatric, in acute inpatient, day case, outpatient settings and delivery in the community.  It covers chemotherapy treatment for all solid tumour and haematological malignancies and those in clinical trials. The dataset has been designed to collect information on all drug treatments with an anti-cancer effect, in all treatment settings, including traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy and all newer agents. Linked data is available for patients diagnosed prior to the start of SACT data collection (diagnoses from 1 Jan 1995 onwards) as well as after the start of SACT data collection, if those patients have received SACT since 1 April 2012 and been included in the SACT dataset. However please note linked data for patients diagnosed prior to the start of SACT is most likely to be available for cancer sites with good prognosis. \nThere are known gaps in the reporting of  the following: \n\u2022 Haematological cancers - likely due to differences in coding and the complexities of treatments.\n\u2022 Childhood and Young adult cancers - likely due to paediatric treatment regimen complexity\n\u2022 Oral and hormone treatments - likely due to these treatments being prescribed outside of the hospital pharmacy setting.\n\nThere may be a restriction on the release of patients receiving treatments funded through the Cancer Drugs Fund. Each request for data will be checked and restrictions applied if required.\n\nNote around SACTv3.0\nThe latest version is SACTv3.0, it was launched in September 2019 on a phased implementation where trusts could submit v2.0 and v3.0. From 01 December 2019 full compliance from trusts was required where only v3.0 should be submitted. Due to several issues with system providers some trusts will still be submitting v2.0 for a longer period than previously expected. The SACT team are working with trusts and system providers to ensure v3.0 is submitted as soon as possible.",

The National Lung Cancer Audit (NLCA) is commissioned by the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP). In 2015 the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) won the tender to run the audit for the next 3\u20135 years. In 2018 the NLCA was awarded the remaining 2 years and will now run until 2020. As part of the new contractual arrangements, a new methodology of data collection was introduced that utilises the COSD. \nThe reason that this data exist on CAS in a separate data file are two-fold:\n1.\tThe data for the audit follow a bespoke data extraction.\na.\tThe data extraction uses the raw COSD files to enrich the completeness on e.g., performance status, FEV1 and CNS presence. \nb.\tThe data also contain derived data specific for the annual report that were prepared by the University of Nottingham. Any questions related to these can be directed back to the audit team. \nc.\tTo approximate the audit in its former iteration, where patient data was submitted by the MDT where they were first seen, an algorithm to identify trust first seen (TFS) was developed in close collaboration with the audit team at RCP. Please note this is different from the NCRAS TFS.\n2.\tThe RCP advertises the re-use of the data used for the annual report on their website. As they cannot directly supply the data, this needs to go through ODR. \nNB! During the production of the National Lung Cancer Audit report, the data provided by NCRAS has in certain instances been excluded or recoded. As such, the National Lung Cancer Audit reported data may be slightly different from the data NCRAS originally provided. From the NCRAS perspective, the most pragmatic way of approaching re-use of the data is to provide the original data we provided to the audit team along with the information in this document stating where we are aware of obvious differences. Data requestors should be aware of this if they are planning to compare this data directly to the audit report. For the NLCA 2016 we only included data for tumours with ICD10-O2 C34 & C45, for all other years we include tumours with ICD10-O2 C33, C34, C37, C38, C39 and mesothelioma ICD10-O2 C45.",

This work can only continue to progress if there is accurate and complete information about the people who are developing cancer. This information is collected through a process called cancer registration.\n\nCancer registration is the systematic collection of data about cancer and tumour diseases. In England, this data collection is managed by NCRAS. Every year, NCRAS collects information on over 300,000 cases of cancer, including patient details (including their name, address, age, sex, and date of birth), as well as detailed data about the type of cancer, how advanced it is and the treatment the patient receives.\n\nSo NCRAS can identify every cancer and ensure complete case ascertainment, it uses a wide range of data sources. These include data sent to NCRAS from:\n\nhistopathology and haematology services\nmedical records\nradiotherapy departments\nhospices\nindependent hospitals\nscreening services\ndeath certificates\nGPs\nother UK cancer registries\n\nBy obtaining data from multiple sources and then matching and merging them as required, NCRAS can build a complete picture of the incidence and prevalence of cancer in England, as well as understanding how cancer patients are diagnosed, treated and their outcomes.\n\nNCRAS also link this information to other health information routinely collected by the NHS (such as information on attendances in hospital) and patient experience surveys, such as Patient Reported Outcome Measures and the National Cancer Patient Experience Survey.",

The swab and blood samples are tested at laboratories.\n\nThe overall purpose of this study is to understand how many people across the UK have or may already have had the coronavirus.

Record-level patient data set, where a record represents one death registration. The data are collected at source from Local Registry offices at the point of death registration. The data are collated nationally by the Register General before being passed to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), for use in statistics and coding. Coding includes such things cause of death coding using the International Classifications of Diseases (ICD) coding system, attributing socio-economic code classifications based on occupation. ONS maintains its own version of the data set for its use in statistics. The Civil Registration of Deaths data contains 14 million unique registrations since 1993 onwards, increasing yearly. Average 500,000 - 600,000 new death registrations yearly. Records cover all deaths registered in England & Wales.\nICD coding is 9th and 10th.\n\nhttps://digital.nhs.uk/services/data-access-request-service-dars",

Therefore, part 1 contains 2, 3 or 4 characters.\n\nIncode\nThe incode is of length 3 characters. The postcode sector is represented by the outcode plus the first digit of the incode. The complete postcode represents the postmans walk.\n\nPoints to Note\nPostcodes for Scotland\n\nThe instructions for determining a postcode given at the front of the Postcode Directories should be followed and the Postcodes entered in the spaces provided, and left justified. There should be no embedded blanks.\nPostcodes as written have two parts. The first part, consisting of one or two letters and one or two numbers identifies the Post Town and Postal district. The second part, consisting of one number and two letters, identifies the Postcode Sector and postmans walk.\nThe postcode of the patients usual address should be entered wherever possible. If only a temporary address is known, then this should be coded.\nIf a postcode cannot be found using the Postcode Directory, the appropriate Postcode Enquiry office should be contacted.\nAddress not known. Where a patients address is not known (but the patient is not of \"no fixed abode\"), and all reasonable means of attempting to trace the address have been exhausted, the dummy postcode \"NK01 0AA\" should be used. The use of this postcode will always be queried.\nThe querying of postcodes valid to sector level was discontinued on 1st April 1998. The whole postcode must be valid to be accepted; if not an error will be produced.\nLocal Government District Dummy Postcodes can no longer be entered.\nThe postcode must be recorded in full\nA list of all valid postcodes in Scotland, together with the permitted dummy postcodes, is held on the computer files at ISD.\nIf the full Postcode is not on the reference file, the record will be flagged with an error message and the postcode must be corrected.\nFor patients who are with the armed forces and based in the United Kingdom, use postcode of their base. For British Forces Posted Overseas who return to Scotland and go direct to hospital for treatment, use the dummy postcode BF01 0AA.\nCross Checks (applicable to SMR only)\n\nIf postcode is OS14AA, OS16AA, OS17AA, OS18AA, then Category of Patient should be 4 or 5 (i.e. overseas visitors). If not, the record will be queried.\nFrom 1st April 2000 if postcode is BF01 0AA and the category of patient is not 3 (NHS), the record will be queried.\nSMR Validation - Postcode\n\nTags:\ngeographic  locations  address  outcode  incode  postal  area  district  SMR00  SMR01  SMR02  SMR04",

The term GP practice covers both partnerships and single-handed practices. Each GP practice in Scotland is identified by a unique GP practice code. The practice code is a four-digit code plus a check digit with ranges of codes allocated to each Health Board.\n(Scottish Morbidity Record - NHS Information Services)\n\nRecording Rules\n\nA standard 5 digit numerical code has been developed for the whole of Scotland. It comprises a 4 digit identifying code, which is within an agreed range for each Health Board, and a check digit.\nIt is the Practice Code of the patients registered GP which is recorded in this field\nIt should be noted that the GP Practice code in England is 6 characters long.\nThe General Practice code should be right justified, with the first character a space, unless it is a valid GP Practice Code from outwith Scotland.\nPoints to Note\n\nPractice code will be used to provide information to GMPs on referral activity.\nThe Practice Code on the patients referral or attendance should be record. If a patient changes GP practice between referral and attendance, the new Practice Code should be recorded.\nDummy practice codes are held in the reference files and are hard coded for validation. These codes are:\n99942 - Patients registered with a private practice only\n99957 - Patients not registered with a GP in the UK\n99961 - Patients where practice code is unknown and who are not covered by codes 99942, 99957, 99976, 99981, 99995 and 99961\n99976 - British armed forces patients not registered with a GP in the UK\n99981 - Foreign visitors not registered with a GP in Scotland\n99995 - Patients registered with a GP in England, Wales or Northern Ireland (excluding patients included under code 99942)\nGPPC is not validated for SMR00 or SMR01 records from Dental Hospitals (G106H, S206H, T113H).\nCross Checks\n\nIf it is a Scottish GPPC it must be a valid practice code which is open on the clinic date (SMR00), date of arrival (SMR30) or admission date (all other record types).\nIf it is a practice outwith Scotland it must be a valid code on the \"Rest of UK\" practice reference file.\nFurther Information\nIt should be noted that patients are no longer registered with an individual GP, but with a practice.\n\nIn NHS Scotland, the practice code is a four-digit code plus a check digit with ranges of codes allocated to each Health Board. ISD maintains a GP Practice code reference file which contains up to date details of address, postcode, telephone number for each GP Practice in Scotland.\n\nIn England and Wales, the field is 6 digits therefore to accommodate cross border patient flows, this should be taken into account.\n\nSMR Validation - General Practitioner Practice Code\nTags:\ngeneral  medical  practitioner  services  registered  GMP  SMR00  SMR01  SMR02  SMR04",

The appropriate admission category depends on the clinical condition of the patient as assessed by the receiving consultant. The patient may or may not be on a waiting list.\n\nNotes\n\nRoutine Admission\nA routine admission occurs when a patient is admitted as planned.\n\nUrgent Admission\nAn urgent admission is a type of emergency admission where the admission is delayed for hospital/patient reasons and the patients condition is such that he/she is not clinically compromised or disadvantaged by the short delay.\n\nAn example of an urgent admission is a patient who attends for an outpatient appointment at which the doctor decides there is a clinical need to admit the patient within the next few days.\n\nNote 1: If the patient is not already on a waiting list, he/she is NOT placed on one for the duration of the delay. Urgent admissions from a waiting list can be identified from the patients Waiting List Type code.\n\nEmergency Admission\nAn emergency admission occurs when, for clinical reasons, a patient is admitted at the earliest possible time after seeing a doctor.\n\nNote 1: The patient may or may not be admitted through Accident & Emergency.\nNote 2: Emergency admissions from a waiting list can be identified from the patients Waiting List Type code\n\nOther Admission\nOther admission is a type of admission which is neither emergency, urgent, routine nor pertains to Maternity or Neonatal admissions, e.g. a patient who is admitted from an outpatient clinic, not for clinical need but because a bed is available.\n\nPoints to Note\n\nRoutine Admission (Code 10)\nThis code should be used for patients being admitted for respite care and for patients routinely re-admitted having exceeded their pass period.\nRoutine Admission: Patient, not on waiting list, admitted on same day (Code 12)If the patient is not already on a waiting list, s/he must be placed on one with a Waiting List Date recorded as the date the decision is made to admit the patient.\nEmergency - deliberate self inflicted injury or poisoning (Code 31)This code should be used ONLY IF THE CASE NOTES HAVE SPECIFIED injury or poisoning as self-inflicted; otherwise the appropriate code should be 33 or 35.\nThe use of codes 19 and 39 will always be queried.\nCodes 40 & 48 are not valid on SMR01.\nEmergency - Road Traffic Accident (Code 32)\nIn strict terms, \"Road Traffic Accident\" is one that involves one or more vehicles on the public highway. However, for SMR01 a looser definition is used, to include not only accidents involving vehicles (cars, buses, motor bikes, etc.) but also pedal bicycles and horses, provided the accident takes place on the public highway.\nEmergency - Home Incident (includes accidental poisoning) (Code 33)\nThis code should be used for any accident, injury or poisoning that takes place in the patients own home or the garden or grounds of that home, provided that there was no intention (determined by medical staff) on the part of the patient to injure or kill himself. This code should also be used when a patient has been the victim of an assault in the home.\nEmergency - Work Incident (includes accidental poisoning) (Code 34)\nThis code should be used for any accident, injury or poisoning that takes place in the patients work place, provided that there was no intention (determined by medical staff) on the part of the patient to injure or kill himself. This code should also be used when a patient has been the victim of an assault in the work place.\nEmergency - Other Injury (includes accidental poisoning) (Code 35)\nThis code should be used for any accident, injury, assault or poisoning that takes place other than in the patients own home or workplace (see notes 7 & 8) provided that there was no intention (determined by medical staff) on the part of the patient to injure or kill himself. This code should also be used for incidents occurring in residential homes.\n\nExample 1\nAn accidental fall from the window of the patients home or jumping from the window to escape a fire would be given Admission Type Code 33, while jumping from the same window intending to commit suicide would be given Admission Type Code 31.\n\nExample 2\nA child drinking, for example, weed killer or bleach, thinking it was lemonade, or taking pills thinking they were sweets, would be given Admission Type Code 33. A patient taking an excessive amount of normal drug in the belief that this might be more beneficial than the stated dose would also be given Admission Type Code 33. However, a patient who takes an overdose of drugs with the intention of suicide, or even as a \"cry for help\", should be given Admission Type Code 31.\n\nExample 3\nA patient is admitted from home with cuts to both wrists.

This is usually a medical consultant but may be another healthcare professional, for example a midwife, GP, nurse or Allied Healthcare Professional.\n\nPoints to Note\n\nA separate SMR record is submitted when a patient changes Specialty, Significant Facility or Consultant/Health Care Professional Responsible for Care on medical grounds.\nEach hospital will have a list of Consultant/Healthcare Professional Responsible for Care PIN numbers appropriate to the hospital concerned. Where GPs have responsibility for patients a list of GMC numbers of the GPs concerned must be available.\nA Senior Registrar/Registrar/Specialist/Associate Specialists code number must not be used in lieu of the Consultant Code number where the clinical responsibility of care is retained by the Consultant. This may apply where patients only consult with non-consultant grade medical staff and do not see the consultant, for example SAS clinicians. For additional information please refer to this flow chart.\nA nurse/AHPs PIN number must not be used in lieu of the Consultant where the clinical responsibility of the care is retained by the consultant. Where nurses and other AHPs run clinics concurrently or separately, but the responsibility for those clinics rests with the consultant, then the activity must not be recorded on SMR00 for the nurse/AHP. This activity must only be recorded under ISD(S)1 Card Class 7 for AHPs or Card Class 9 for nurses. For additional information please refer to this flow chart.\n\nFurther clarification on points 3&4\n\nA SMR should be attributed to the person who is clinically responsible for care (not just for an outpatient appointment).\nWhere a HCP has determined/prescribed a course of treatment for a patient but has someone else deliver care on their behalf then the SMR should be attributed to the original HCP who would remain clinically responsible for care.\nHowever, when a HCP refers the patient to another specialty for alternative/additional treatment or care then the SMR should be attributed to the new HCP who would then be clinically responsible for the alternative/additional care.\n\nFor example\nIf an Oncologist has prescribed a course of Chemotherapy for a patient but this is delivered by a specialist nurse then the SMR should be attributed to the Consultant. SMR for Oncologist\nIf an Orthopaedic Surgeon considers that the patient needs an orthotic then they would refer them to the Orthotic Team who would then determine best orthotic/treatment plan for the patient. SMR for Orthotics\n\nIt is important to continue recording this data item in this way to allow for comparison/trends across the years.\nA New data item will be introduced in due course to record the Staff Group who delivered Care, e.g. SAS, Specialist Nurse, AHP and this will pick up who is actually seeing the patient.\n\nThese two data items will then complement each other, but measure two types of activity.\n\nIt is the NHS Board responsibility to ensure any new HCP they appoint who meets the definition above is entered in to the National Reference files to ensure records pass validation. This can be done via the eForms process, and must include the date from which the appointment is to be regarded as effective, together with the specialty/discipline or specialties/disciplines in which the HCP may work. When a HCP retires, dies or moves elsewhere, the effective end date should also be amended on the system. Details of how the add HCPs to the reference files can be found here.\nSMR00s must not be completed:-\n- Where a Midwifery clinic is overseen by an obstetrician\n- Where a nurse is carrying out routine nursing work such as bloods, dressings etc\nFor SMR02 records this should reflect the person who was responsible for the care of the mother on original admission to the unit.\nExample 1 - If the mother was originally admitted under the care of a midwife in an Alongside Midwifery Unit (AMU) or Freestanding Midwifery Unit (FMU), then the midwife should be recorded in this section, irrespective if the mother was then transferred during her care episode.\nExample 2 - If the mother was originally admitted to an Obstetric Unit then the Consultant initially responsible for her care should be recorded here, irrespective of whether care was primarily provided by midwifery staff.\nRecording Rules\n\nIt is the Hospitals responsibility to register individuals on the National Reference Files that meet the definition of Consultant/HCP Responsible for Care as above.\n\nThe 7 digit General Medical Council (GMC) Number allocated to each doctor is used as the consultant code. The General Dental Council Number consists of D + 6 numberic.\n\nThe 8 digit personal identification number (PIN) allocated to other healthcare professionals (e.g. midwives) is used as the HCP code. In the case of a midwife the PIN consists of an 8 character alpha/numeric code, although this format may differ for other HCPs (e.g. Podiatrists).\n\nRecording GMC/GDC/PIN\nThe code number of the HCP who had clinical responsibility for the patient during the episode should be right justified in the character spaces provided.\n\nCross Checks\n\nConsultant GMC/HCP number must be present on the appropriate reference file. It is important that additions and changes are notified to ISD as soon as possible. Request Forms for updating of the Consultant/HCP reference files can be found here .\nThe GMC/HCP number must be on the reference file at clinic date (record type SMR00) or Admission Date (record type SMR01, 02 and 04).\nIf the record type is SMR02 and an 8 digit HCP code is used, Specialty/Discipline must be T2 or T21 (midwife).\nSMR Validation - HCP Responsible for Care\n\nRelated terms: Healthcare professional\n\nTags:\nprofessional  healthcare  episode  consultant  nurse  AHP  midwife  GP  GMC  SMR00  SMR01  SMR02  SMR04",

Examples of disciplines are physiotherapy, nursing, pharmacology.\n\nRecording Rules\nThis field should be coded to the Specialty/Discipline of the consultant/GP/HCP who is in charge of the patient episode. If the consultant is formally recognised and contracted to work in more than one specialty then the patients problem or condition should dictate the specialty.\n\nNote that this is the ONLY rule for completing this field.

Record Significant Facility as 11 (Other: including all Standard Specialty Wards, Clinical Facility 1K, Day Bed Unit 1J).\nYounger Physically Disabled: Record the Specialty of the consultant in charge of the patient, which will usually be geriatric medicine. Record Significant Facility as 18 (Ward for Younger Physically Disabled) or 1E (Long Stay Unit for Care of the Elderly).\nSee additional notes under Significant Facility.\nFor SMR02 records this should reflect the speciality of the person who was responsible for the care for the mother on original admission.\nExample 1- If the mother was originally admitted under the care of a midwife in an Alongside Midwifery Unit (AMU) or Freestanding Midwifery Unit (FMU), then the midwifery specialty should be recorded in this section, irrespective of whether the mother was then transferred to an Obstetric unit during labour/delivery.

        "description": "NHS Wales hospital admissions (Inpatients and daycases) dataset comprising of attendance and clinical information for all hospital admissions: includes diagnoses and operations performed. Includes spell and episode level data.\n\nThe data are collected and coded at each hospital. Administrative information is collected from the central PAS (Patient Administrative System), such as specialty of care, admission and discharge dates. After the patient is discharged the handwritten patient notes are transcribed by clinical coder into medical coding terminology (ICD10 and OPCS).\n\nThe data held in PEDW is of interest to public health services since it can provide information regarding both health service utilisation and also the incidence and prevalence of disease. However, since PEDW was created to track hospital activity from the point of view of payments for services, rather than epidemiological analysis, the use of PEDW for public health work is not straightforward. For example:\n\nCounts will vary depending on the number of diagnosis fields used e.g. primary only, all fields;\nThere are a number of different things that can be counted in PEDW e.g. individual episodes of care, admissions, discharges, periods of continuous care (group of episodes), patients or procedures.\nWhen looking at diagnosis or procedures the number will vary depending on whether you look at only in the primary diagnosis / procedure field or if the secondary fields are also included.\nCoding practices vary. In particular, coding practices for recording secondary diagnoses is likely to vary for different hospitals. This makes regional variations more difficult to interpret. The validation process led by the Corporate Health Improvement Programme and implemented by NWIS is aiming to address some of these inconsistencies.\n\nDue to the complexity and pitfalls of PEDW it is recommended that any PEDW requests for public health purposes are discussed with a member of the SAIL team. In turn the SAIL will seek advice from NWIS if required.",

        "description": "We aim to assess the feasibility of delivering a supported self-management incorporating an adapted pictorial asthma action plan for adult patients with asthma in clinical practice in a public primary care clinic in the Klang District, Selangor State, Malaysia. Dataset contains follow-up responses at one-, three- and six-months post intervention. \n\nSupported self-management has been shown to reduce asthma-related morbidity and mortality in high-income countries, but poor health literacy (especially in low- and middle-income countries) is a potential barrier to its effectiveness. This study aims to assess the feasibility of delivering supported self-management incorporating an adapted pictorial asthma action plan for adult patients with asthma attending a public primary care clinic in Malaysia. This study will proceed in two phases: 1) adaptation of the pictorial asthma action plan (AAP); and 2) a feasibility study including  feasibility of assessing costs. Following the adaptation of the AAP, we assess the feasibility of using the AAP to support self-management in adults with asthma. In a pre-post study, 70 patients aged 18 years and above with physician-diagnosed asthma and currently prescribed inhaled corticosteroids will be recruited. Our proposed primary outcome is asthma control (Global Initiative for Asthma symptom control). A pre-piloted questionnaire will be used to collect baseline data on socio-demography, healthcare utilisation and expenditure, health literacy, clinical parameters (body mass index; peak expiratory flow rate).  Follow-up will be at 1, 3, and 6 months. \n\nThe protocol was approved by the Medical Research Ethics Committee, Ministry of Health Malaysia and registered with National Medical Research Registry (NMRR-18-2683-43494). The study trial registration number is ISRCTN87128530 (Pre-results).",
