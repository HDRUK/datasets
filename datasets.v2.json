At the start of this period, the Careers Wales had just been formed from six regional Careers companies, and their CRM system was initially populated with imports from the preceding companies\u2019 systems. Between 2012 and the present Careers Wales has worked to rationalise the varied approaches to recording, enhance the quality and suitability of the data they gather, and to simplify the data entry requirements for their staff as far as possible. Therefore users of the data will very likely notice changes over time in the nature of the data.\n\nCareers Wales stores information on all its interactions, services provided, etc. as entities called histories. Within their CRM, different on-screen fields can be enabled or disabled for different history types \u2013 therefore a history representing a Group Session would contain information on the duration of the session, the topic and the venue; whereas a history for a Traineeship Referral Form completion would not display any of these fields.\n\nAll the numerically coded columns in Careers Wales\u2019 supplied data can be decoded via the accompanying lookup file - HISTORIES_LOOKUP_1545_20200821.CSV.",

We involved school staff, healthcare professionals and policymakers in focus groups/interviews to inform the development of Culturally-Tailored school-based for Asthma in Malaysia (CuT-AsthMa) programme. We had 52 participants: 39 school staff, 11 healthcare professionals and two policymakers. The summary of our data is described using a codebook consisting of codes and the description used to analyse the focus groups/interviews. The codebook was developed using open codes, categories (collation of open codes) and themes. We used this codebook to aid in constructing a schema to inform the development of the CuT-AsthMa programme. Other documents include an invitation letter to participants, a set of participant information sheet and consent. The data in this study is to support part of the PhD work at the Usher Institute, the University of Edinburgh. Due to the sensitivity of the data and to protect the confidentiality of the participants involved in this study, the raw data will be deposited in DataVault at the University of Edinburgh.\n\nFor further information, see: https://www.ed.ac.uk/usher/respire/phd-studentships/siti-nurkamilla-ramdzan",

Both SGSS and Respiratory DataMart have been adapted and combined to capture detections of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 testing started in UK laboratories on 24 January 2020. This data is reported through a combination of laboratory systems (SGSS and Respiratory DataMart). The majority of testing to date has been offered to those in hospital with a medical need as well as NHS key workers, rather than the general population. Confirmed cases therefore represent the typical population of people with severe disease rather than all of those who get infected.",

        "description": "Spirometry is considered as a gold standard to detect the obstructive airway diseases (OADs) such as asthma and COPD. In India, use of spirometry among physicians and researchers to diagnose OADs is increasing day by day. Predictive values generated based on healthy population are used in interpretation of spirometry data. Currently, in India, most of the predicted values used in the spirometry data interpretation are based on predictive values from western populations. As no predictive values are available for the Indian population, physicians and researchers from India depend on the western countries guidelines such as ERS, ECHRS for the predictive values. A few attempts have been made to generate the predictive values for Indian population, but no conclusion has been drawn. We propose to use spirometry data from 2,500 adults from Vadu Health and Demographic Surveillance System (Vadu HDSS) population to develop the predictive values for the Western Indian population.\n\nFor further information, see: https://www.ed.ac.uk/usher/respire/chronic-respiratory-disorders/spirometry-predictive-values",

Most patients have poor knowledge about asthma and despite the availability of effective treatment, asthma control is reported to be unsatisfactory. Disease management and prevention is suboptimal and has an impact on the economic burden. As not much is known about what actually contributes to poor asthma control in our region, improving understanding on factors related to disease burden could contribute significantly to improved asthma morbidity. The aim of this project is to develop a cohort of adults and children with asthma in Klang district in Malaysia to enable epidemiology, disease management and economic burden of asthma to be studied and interventions directed at patients and health care practice level to be carried out to improve asthma care. \n\nFor further information, see: https://www.ed.ac.uk/usher/respire/chronic-respiratory-disorders/asthma-care",

        "description": "Bariatric surgery produces substantial, long-term weight loss with reduced morbidity and mortality. Genetics can strongly influence this response, as well as the initial propensity to obesity. Several genes have been implicated but more in-depth mechanistic studies are needed to understand how genes affect energy regulation and mediate the beneficial effects of bariatric surgery.\nThe Obesity Research Biobank Syndicate (ORBiS) aims to fulfil this need. It provides a comprehensive collection of high-quality biological samples and patient data to facilitate mechanistic research and help translate it to improved treatments for patients. \nPatients undergoing bariatric surgery are recruited from multiple centres in the UK. With informed consent, blood or saliva samples are collected pre-operatively and tissue collected during surgery. Samples include: adipose tissue (subcutaneous and visceral), muscle, liver, stomach and small intestine. Relevant clinical and demographic data are linked and stored pseudo anonymised in a secure database. Tissue collections are transported to and processed in the ORBiS laboratory at University College London, and stored at UCL-Royal Free Hospital Biobank for future use.\nResearch programmes will be supported within and beyond the contributing sites. External researchers will be required to obtain individual REC approval prior to submitting an application.",

Risk stratification is based on BM immunophenotyping and SFLC ratio. All patients will receive standard local radiotherapy; this is not regarded as trial treatment and may be administered prior to study entry.\n- Patients with high-risk features will be randomised to receive adjuvant therapy in the form of lenalidomide and dexamethasone or no further treatment.\n- Patients without high-risk features will receive no further therapy and will be observed according to local practice.\n140 patients:\n- 98 patients with high risk features to be randomised at a 1:1 ratio\n- 42 low risk patients for registration only",

Quantitative data is collected from GPs practising in study area to understand their qualification and type of practice and their involvement in asthma & COPD diagnosis and management. Qualitative data is collected from few GPs (using in depth interview tools) in study area who has good experience about diagnosis and management of asthma & COPD. Their perceptions and practices about their clinical practice are documented.\n\nLong-term lung conditions, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), are very common and can affect people\u2019s well-being, and ability to work and care for their families.\n\nRespiratory symptoms are common but weak primary health care systems in resource-poor countries are often unable to diagnose the underlying disease condition, leading to inappropriate treatment. A lack of diagnosis also means the true burden of the disease is not appreciated.\n\nTo improve treatment of these conditions, we first need to understand how primary care doctors (who provide the majority of healthcare for rural populations in India) diagnose and treat people with chest symptoms, what makes it difficult for them to provide good care and how they think care can be improved.\n\nTo work with primary care doctors in the Pune district in India, to determine their thoughts on the diagnosis and management of lung conditions.\n\nFor further information, see: https://www.ed.ac.uk/usher/respire/respire-fellowships/dhiraj-agarwal",

        "description": "Introduction: Following the emergence of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019 and the ensuing COVID-19 pandemic, population-level surveillance and rapid assessment of the effectiveness of existing or new therapeutic or preventive interventions are required to ensure that interventions are targeted to those at highest risk of serious illness or death from COVID-19. We aim to repurpose and expand an existing pandemic reporting platform to determine the attack rate of SARS-CoV-2, the uptake and effectiveness of any new pandemic vaccine (once available) and any protective effect conferred by existing or new antimicrobial drugs and other therapies.\n\nMethods and analysis: A prospective observational cohort will be used to monitor daily/weekly the progress of the COVID-19 epidemic and to evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions in approximately 5.4?million individuals registered in general practices across Scotland. A national linked dataset of patient-level primary care data, out-of-hours, hospitalisation, mortality and laboratory data will be assembled. The primary outcomes will measure association between: (A) laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, morbidity and mortality, and demographic, socioeconomic and clinical population characteristics; and (B) healthcare burden of COVID-19 and demographic, socioeconomic and clinical population characteristics. The secondary outcomes will estimate: (A) the uptake (for vaccines only); (B) effectiveness; and (C) safety of new or existing therapies, vaccines and antimicrobials against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The association between population characteristics and primary outcomes will be assessed via multivariate logistic regression models. The effectiveness of therapies, vaccines and antimicrobials will be assessed from time-dependent Cox models or Poisson regression models. Self-controlled study designs will be explored to estimate the risk of therapeutic and prophylactic-related adverse events.\n\nhttps://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/10/6/e039097",

        "description": "The National Diabetes Audit (NDA) is part of the National Clinical Audit and Patient Outcomes Programme, which is managed by the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP) and funded by NHS England. \n\nRelease Date Information:\nCore NDA data collection\nCore NDA data is collected and released on a quarterly and annual basis.\nAnnual audit collection period\nThe Core NDA collects information for a 15-month audit period. This is collected from both primary and secondary care services \u2013 for example:\n\u2022\t2018-19 audit collected for the period 1 January 2018 to 31 March 2019\n\u2022\t2019-20 audit collects for the period 1 January 2019 to 31 March 2020\n\u2022\t2020-21 audit collects for the period 1 January 2020 to 31 March 2021\nAnnual data is typically released in November. \nQuarterly data collection\nThe data is extracted quarterly from general practices via the General Practice Extraction Service. \nIndicative timings for extraction are:\n\u2022\tAugust 2019: collection of data from January to June 2019\n\u2022\tNovember 2019: collection of data from January to September 2019\n\u2022\tFebruary 2020: collection of data from January to December 2019\n\u2022\tMay 2020: collection of full audit year data \nThe first 3 quarters of data are typically published the month after extraction.\nThe NDA started in 2003-4 as part of the Diabetes National Service Framework (NSF) implementation plan to provide reliable measurements for service improvement and monitor the impact of the NSF. The core components of the NDA were designed to align with the Diabetes NSF, The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines and Quality Standards in respect of achievement rates for annual care process, and treatment targets and disease measure including premature mortality.  It integrates data reflecting contributions from all primary and secondary care providers and captures data on over 3 million people with diabetes each year. \n\nSince 2010 new elements have been incorporated into the audit programme to include specialised care pathways. The NDA programme now reports on:\n\n\u2022\tCare processes and Treatment Targets (NDA Core)\n\u2022\tComplications and Mortality (NDA Core) \n\u2022\tPregnancy in women with diabetes (NPID)\n\u2022\tFoot ulcer management in people with diabetes (NDFA)\n\u2022\tContinuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion in people with Type 1 Diabetes \n\u2022\tCare of in-patients with diabetes (NaDIA) \n\u2022\tComplications related to the four main harms that can occur to inpatients with diabetes in Acute hospitals in England (NaDIA \u2013 Harms)\n\u2022\tTransitional care for people with diabetes through childhood to adulthood\n\u2022\tProgress on invitation to attend and uptake of offer in the NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme \n\nThe inclusion of NDA in the GP Contract allowed collection of data directly from primary care systems via the General Practice Extraction Service (GPES) for NDA Core primary care data. This has resulted in increased participation and reduction in burden on primary care providers due to the automated nature of GPES. Participation from both primary care and secondary care has increased year on year, now at its highest level since NDA commenced in 2003.\n\nhttps://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/clinical-audits-and-registries/national-diabetes-audit",

The HBRC resides within the purpose-built Advanced Therapies Facility (ATF) within the College of Medical and Dental Sciences (CMDS) at the University of Birmingham (UoB). The ATF also houses both cell and gene therapy manufacturing units.\nSamples are collected, processed and stored (or released) from patients in a variety of disease settings in response to local demand and research strategies in order to facilitate existing research and enable future research areas to be developed. Samples may comprise adult or paediatric tissue which is waste, or surplus to diagnosis taken at the time of surgery or treatment, additional samples taken specifically for research purposes, material taken from patients enrolled in clinical trials, and control material. The HBRC works with local researchers and carries out bespoke tissue collections. All samples can be annotated with the appropriate clinical data which makes them scientifically useful. \nAlthough the HBRC is primarily a resource for local researchers within CMDS and local NHS Trusts, applications from other UK research groups and the commercial sector are also considered. The policy and procedures associated with the review of these applications, and the subsequent release of samples and associated data, are the same for both internal and external applicants. All samples and associated data are released for research in a fully anonymised form, and a Tissue Transfer Agreement ensures that they will only be used for the purposes approved at release and will not be transferred without written permission. In order to enhance the value of the HBRC collection, every attempt is made to secure the return of useful research data following the completion of research studies.",

        "description": "https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.201905-1017OC \n\nIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by the build-up of scar tissue in the lungs. It is believed that the damage to the alveolar epithelium is followed by an aberrant wound healing response leading to the deposition of dense fibrotic tissue, reducing the lungs\u2019 flexibility and inhibiting gas transfer. IPF still has limited therapeutic interventions and a high mortality rate within 3-5 years from diagnosis. To date, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of IPF susceptibility have associated common variants (minor allele frequency [MAF]>5%) near genes involved in host defence, telomere maintenance, cell-cell adhesion and signalling in disease susceptibility. \nMeta-analysis of GWAS of IPF susceptibility. Building up on published GWAS results (PMID: 24429156, 23583980, 29066090) and novel study samples, we have performed the largest GWAS of IPF susceptibility to date to identify novel genes and further advance in the understanding of IPF pathogenesis and risk (bioRxiv https://doi.org/10.1101/636761 and PMID:31710517). The discovery stage of the study comprised up to 2,668 IPF cases and 8,591 controls from 3 studies (Chicago study: 541 IPF cases and 542 controls, Colorado study: 1515 fibrotic Idiopathic Interstitial pneumonia cases and 4683 controls, UK Study: 612 IPF cases and 3366 controls)  and replication was pursued in an additional 1,456 IPF cases and 11,874 controls. The genome-wide association study summary statistics from the meta-analysis of three studies totalling  2,668 cases and 8,591 controls are available here.",

Alongside concerns about the prevalence of these infections, there has been a renewed interest in involving community health workers (CHWs) in various public health programs. However, as CHWs are increasingly asked to take on different tasks there is a risk that their workload may become unmanageable. One approach to help reduce this burden is the use of mobile technology-based healthcare solutions (mHealth) in the community. We aimed to appraise the available literature on CHW based mHealth approaches for caregivers to improve knowledge and management about common childhood infections and to develop a mobile application which lady health workers (LHWs) will use in their monthly visits to counsel caregivers on inder five pneumonia.\n\nFor further information, see: https://www.ed.ac.uk/usher/respire/phd-studentships/hana-mahmood",

We host large deeply phenotyped cohort of patients, linked databases and biological samples. Our academic partnership extends to industry links and we do have experience in developing and evaluating, drugs, devices and health care interventions.\nNIHR NDDBRU has a mission to take the most promising basic biomedical research breakthroughs and translate them into patient benefit. We focus on developing novel tests, techniques as well as new treatments. We perform experimental medicine investigations into mechanisms underlying disease processes using biological samples from people; we evaluate the efficacy of interventions in volunteers and patients.\nOur research focus is on 'The infections, inflammation and consequences in the GI tract and liver'.",

The survey was conducted by Quality Health in conjunction with three cancer registries in England. The survey measured the overall quality of life of representative samples of cancer survivors with breast, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL) diagnosed during July 2006 - July 2010. Quality of life was assessed at four different time points after diagnosis at approximately one, two, three or five years. As this was a pilot survey, numbers are small and data governance issues will need to be carefully considered on a study by study basis. Outcome items in the survey are made up of Euroqol 5-level (EQ-5D), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT), and Social Difficulties Inventory (SDI) items.",

The cohort includes just over 24,000 participants recruited 2006-11, with most consenting to record linkage and recontact. Participants gave blood or saliva samples (for processing, biochemistry and cryopreservation) and a urine sample.  The blood or saliva samples were processed to DNA and extensive genotyping was carried out on over 20,000 participants by 2015, with DNA methylation assayed on 10,000 by 2019. Follow up is primarily through record linkage and includes linkage to GP records and also via online questionnaires, including CovidLife.y history and lifestyle information from over 24,000 volunteers.  it is an intensively phenotyped, family-based cohort for the study of the genetic basis of common complex diseases and response to treatments.

We house a vast array of biosamples, both cancerous and non-cancerous, and have the ability to collect bespoke samples and data to suit the needs of researchers. We have access to a wide variety of samples types including, but not limited to, frozen tissue, fresh tissue, blood products, urine and FFPE blocks. \n\nThe LBIH Biobank can further process these into a number of products such as DNA, frozen sections, and cryo-aliquots. In order to offer a 'one-stop shop' for research, we offer additional services such as IHC, next generation sequencing, TMA creation, and project management for studies and projects, to include storage of trial samples.\n\nWe provide access to collection of samples and data across the following diseases: \n\u2022\tMalignant melanoma of eye (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant neoplasm of endometrium of corpus uteri (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant neoplasm of liver\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of adrenal gland (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of cervix\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of kidney (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of oral cavity (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of prostate (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of stomach (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of thyroid gland (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of urinary bladder (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of vulva (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of breast\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of colon\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of oesophagus\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of ovary\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of pancreas",

For most of the samples, aliquots are kept at different temperatures (-80\u00cb\u0161C or -25\u00cb\u0161C) and different volumes (original sample and concentrated aliquot). \nThe key attribute of the Scottish HPV archive is the annotation of samples with HPV and vaccination status as well as pathology information. Such linkage is possible in Scotland with the help of the Community Health Index (CHI), Scottish Cervical Call and Recall System (SCCRS) and Cancer Registry.",

Material is available to researchers internationally following registration with the tissue bank.  Jointly funded by the MRC and Wellcome Trust, the biobank has been operating since 1999 and is based at two centres: Institute of Genetic Medicine '\u201c Newcastle University and the Institute of Child Health '\u201c University College London.\nTissues can be dissected to meet specific research needs and samples supplied fixed or frozen for histology or nucleic acid extraction, or the tissue can be collected into culture media to be used to establish cell lines. Material pre-sectioned to microscope slides is available for immunohistochemistry (IHC) or tissue in situ hybridisation studies (TISH) and stage, tissue specific RNA/DNA/cDNA can be requested.\nOur In House Gene Expression Service will perform IHC or TISH experiments on behalf of registered users and provide them with high quality annotated images of results ready for publication.",

        "description": "GOSH is the custodian of the most recent study dataset (\u201cIMPORT\u201d - 650 patients, 2012-2019). All of the trial/study datasets include: Full patient and tumour\ndemographics, including associated congenital abnormalities, tumour stage, treatment received (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy) with individual drug names and doses and additional pathological details on histological subtype (risk group), follow up for relapse and death. In addition, the most recent study \u2013 \u201cIMPORT\u201d (Improving Population Outcomes for Renal Tumours of childhood) contains data on the presenting symptoms that led to diagnosis of kidney cancer,\nan imaging archive of CT and MRI scans sent for central radiology review and biological samples (frozen tumour, blood, normal kidney) stored centrally on ~two\nthirds of cases. There is also tumour genomic copy number data available on about one third of the prior trial \u2013 SIOP WT 2001 (that ran in the UK, 2002-2011).\n\nChildhood renal tumour dataset\n\nThis document describes the research dataset constructed through the Improving Population Outcomes for Renal Tumours of childhood (IMPORT) study from 2012 \u2013 2019 (https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/find-a-clinical-trial/study-improving-treatment-children-kidney-cancer. The aim of this prospective clinical observational study is to achieve continuous improvement in short and long term outcomes for children with Wilms tumour and other rarer types of childhood renal tumours. The study collects clinical, molecular and imaging data to underpin the introduction of a more personalised approach to risk stratification \u2013 the process by which each child is assigned to one of several \u2018standard of care\u2019 treatment arms according to the predicted risk of their tumour recurring. \n\nIt is a live database, currently comprising data on 670 children with kidney tumours who are resident across the UK and Republic of Ireland. This represents >90% of all incident cases diagnosed in the population. Clinical data and patient samples are collected with explicit consent of their parent/guardian for use in research and for sharing with the relevant national cancer registration service according to where the child is resident at diagnosis.\n\nData are collected throughout the patient journey and are presented in tables with each data item as a comma separated value (CSV) corresponding to a data field captured through a case report form (CRF). These span the following timepoints from presentation to completion of treatment and then annual follow up or reporting of any events (relapse/death/second tumour). \n\nF1 Registration information\nF2 Pre-operative chemotherapy (Unilateral tumours only)\nF3 Surgical form \u2013 operative findings\nF4 Pathology form \u2013 institutional pathologist\nF6 Post-operative chemotherapy\nF11 Cardiotoxicity reporting form\nF12 Bilateral Wilms tumour form \u2013 additional registration information (12a) and response assessment (12b)\nF15 Reference Pathology \u2013 \u201cCentral review\u201d\nF17 Treatment of relapse or progression\nF18 Follow up form \u2013 for annual follow up reporting and to report any relapse or death.\nF20A End of treatment summary (Unilateral tumours)\nF20B End of treatment summary (Bilateral tumours)\n\nDetails of the content of each CRF are in the table below.\n\nMost children (~90%) with Wilms tumour survive their cancer. Hence, an important aspect of the dataset is the planned linkage of each child\u2019s data to their national cancer registration record. This will permit measurement of very long term health outcomes in adulthood by linkage to routine health care data utilising the approved information governance systems through which the UK\u2019s national cancer registration services work with the NHS to ensure patient confidentiality. \n\nThe IMPORT study is one of five sequential clinical trials and studies that registered the majority of children diagnosed with kidney cancer in the UK and Republic of Ireland between 1980-2019 (over 3,000 patients). It is intended that these additional four closed trial datasets will be made available in the same way during 2020.\n\nThese trials\u2019 primary endpoints, of relapse-free and overall survival according to clinically defined risk groups, have been published, with full clinical quality assurance completed. Over that 39 year period, risk stratification and treatment schedules have been refined many times, to reduce exposure to therapies that may cause long term side effects such as heart damage or second tumours. These adverse \u2018late effects\u2019 may take decades before they are first seen. Hence, these linked datasets are an important proof of principle about how very long term outcomes can be studied through linkage of clinical trials to routine health care data sources.  \n\nThe IMPORT dataset will continue to be enlarged and enriched with tumour molecular information (copy number, genomic sequencing) and imaging review data (CT/MRI scans). These data items are not available for the previous closed trials.\n\n\nOptional material if needed:\n\nPlans for the linked dataset with the national cancer registration and analysis service (NCRAS) of Public Health England. \n\nThis project will create a new permanent data linkage between each patient\u2019s trial identifier and data and their existing national cancer registration record, with all personally identifiable data being handled within the existing nationally approved information governance and data protection frameworks of the clinical trial units and the cancer registration service of each nation. The following technical description applies to Public Health England\u2019s National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS). Access to the linked community prescription data is made available through PHE\u2019s Office for Data Release.\n\nNCRAS routinely collects and quality assures clinical information on all cases of cancer that occur in people living in England to construct a cancer registration record.  The data collected by NCRAS comes from several sources including Multi-Disciplinary Team meetings and pathology reports. The patient identifiers collected facilitate linkage to other routinely collected datasets, that include Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) with details of all admissions, A&E attendances and outpatient appointments at NHS hospitals in England, mortality data, the Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy and Radiotherapy datasets from all hospital providers and community dispensed prescriptions data. \n\nPatient-level linkage to inpatient HES is routinely processed by NCRAS. PHE receives pseudonymised dispensed prescriptions data from NHS Business Services Authority, allowing patient-level linkage to the National Cancer Registration Dataset without revealing the identities of those without cancer.  Prescription data is available from April 2015 to February 2019, providing a 3-4 year window of prescription drug usage by survivors of childhood renal tumours. \n\nThe project\u2019s primary aim is addressed by calculating cumulative and relative risks of hospitalisation for specific organ dysfunctions from the HES-linked data set and relative risks of prescriptions for specific drugs compared to the general population rates. This newly created linked dataset can be refreshed for future follow up studies and linkage to additional datasets that may become available such as patient-reported outcome measures.\n\nFor HES-based analyses, follow-up will start at whichever is the later of 1 April 1997 and date of renal tumour diagnosis.  For community prescriptions analyses, follow-up will start at whichever is the later of 1 April 2015 and date of renal tumour diagnosis.  For both sets of analyses, follow-up will end at whichever is earliest of death, emigration, latest date for which linked death certificate data are complete, and the latest date for which data are complete in the linked databases for HES or community prescriptions as applicable.\n\nCumulative risk of hospitalisation for specific organ dysfunctions will be estimated from the HES-linked data set with death treated as a competing risk.  Relative risk of hospitalisation for specific organ dysfunctions will be estimated by dividing the observed number in the HES-linked data set by the expected number obtained by multiplying the number of person-years accumulated in each age-sex-calendar year stratum in the study cohort by the general population rate in the corresponding stratum calculated from the entire HES database.  Relative risks of prescriptions for specific drugs will be estimated in a similar way using the linked community prescription data set and the entire community prescription database.\n\nThe IMPORT study is one of five sequential clinical trials and studies that registered the majority of children diagnosed with kidney cancer in the UK and Republic of Ireland between 1980-2019 (over 3,000 patients). It is intended that these additional four closed trial datasets will be made available in the same way during 2020",

The study comprises two separate cohorts, a Birth Cohort and a 5-year-old Cohort.  The birth cohort is further split into two sub-groups, postnatal and antenatal, allocation to these groups is determined by the time of recruitment.  Recruitment to the two cohorts is currently ongoing across the UK.  A large amount of phenotypic and environmental exposure data is being collected via questionnaires and record linkage. A data dictionary, available on the study website, contains details of all the available data.  \nAs a minimum, biological mother and affected child are recruited to the study.  Where possible, biological father or mother's partner is also recruited.  In addition, the study aims to recruit unaffected and affected siblings for a small proportion of the cohort.  \nBiological samples are collected from all participants.  Parents and siblings of both cohorts and affected children of the 5-year-old cohort provide saliva samples.  Residual tissue and blood samples are collected from affected children recruited to the birth cohort.  In addition, cord blood samples are collected from families recruited to the antenatal strand.",

        "description": "COVID-19 is a pandemic having devastating implications on healthcare systems globally. Evidence shows that COVID-19 infected patients with pneumonia may present on chest x-rays with a pattern that is difficult to characterise using only the human eye. Therefore, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques using deep learning, which can consistently identify infected patients from non-infected ones given a radiographic examination of the patient, can be used as a reliable diagnostic tool. Considering chest x-rays are one of the most commonly performed radiological studies (coupled with the near universal availability of testing machines), applying AI techniques on them could prove to be valuable for COVID-19 diagnosis during clinical management. We therefore aim to establish a reliable diagnostic tool based on a deep-learning framework for the screening of patients who present with COVID-19 related abnormalities on chest x-rays. Over the course of 7 months we will build a dataset using open source data which are freely available, as well as with de-identified patient data collected from health institutions in Pakistan. Using this dataset, a deep learning model will be trained, which would be able to accurately screen patients who present with abnormalities relevant to COVID-19 in their radiographic examination. This tool will ultimately aid in expediting the diagnosis and referral of COVID-19 patients, resulting in improved clinical outcomes.\n\nFor further information, see: https://www.ed.ac.uk/usher/respire/covid-19/covid-19-detection-chest-x-rays",

It includes babies in whom anomalies are diagnosed at any time from conception to the end of the first year of life. Data collection commenced on 1st January 1998 and includes any baby where pregnancy ended after this date.\n\nCARIS uses a multi-source data collection method using a wide range of sources within the NHS. This ranges from antenatal ultrasound, clinical letters, post-mortems and laboratory results. CARIS also accesses a number of databases including SHIRE (Medical Genetics database), PEDW, NCCHD, Paediatric Cardiology database. Medical records are accessed to confirm, validate and add further details to the information already collected.\n\nDue to the nature of this dataset linkage based on the babies is challenging. This is because many pregnancies (approximately 20% of the total) end in fetal loss or termination. However, linkage based on the mother can be performed.",

Recruitment has taken place in Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland since 2013 and is ongoing, with >10,000 participants aged 30-69 to date. The population of Leicester is diverse and additional recruitment from the local South Asian community is ongoing. Participants provided a DNA sample, have consented to follow-up for up to 25 years through electronic health records and additional bespoke data collection is planned. Data available includes baseline demographics, anthropometry, spirometry, lifestyle factors (smoking and alcohol use) and longitudinal health information from primary care records, with additional linkage to other EHR datasets planned. Patients have consented to be contacted for recall-by-genotype and recall-by-phenotype sub-studies. Genome-wide genotype data are available via EGA for 5218 individuals.",

There is a range of sample types including viable cells and DNA from bone marrow, plasma and CSF supporting many different types of project. \nThe Bank is open to international as well as UK-based researchers where at least one of the investigators is based at a UK university or NHS institution. Applications are reviewed rapidly by an independent review panel. Our team can give help and advice at all stages of the application from initial enquiry to dispatch of samples. \nThe Bank also holds a collection of HLA typed cord blood which are subject to the same review process.",

        "description": "Chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) in low resource settings are neglected and often poorly diagnosed, leading to missed opportunities for early initiation of treatment and poor patient pathways. For example, in India, lung cancer often emerges on a background of chronic respiratory symptoms and is often not diagnosed at all \u2013 or at a very late stage. Because of late presentation and a range of other factors, survival from lung cancer in India is very low. At present we know very little about how knowledge and attitudes relating to CRD in poor, rural populations in India might be influenced by health and behavioural interventions. Psychological theory-based interventions must be culturally appropriate and grounded in the local context. As such, it\u2019s vital we develop this understanding if we are to change behaviours and reduce exposure to common risk factors, such as smoking and indoor cooking smoke.\n\nThe PhD study aims to gather evidence through systematic review of literature about TPB based health interventions and conduct qualitative studies to inform the which constructs of TPB are important in developing an educational intervention which can effectively change the knowledge, attitude and health behaviour of people with CRD in these low resource settings. \n\nFor further information, see: https://www.ed.ac.uk/usher/respire/phd-studentships/biswajit-paul",

        "description": "The data is derived from linked primary, secondary and tertiary care electronic health records and participant survey responses. Data is de-identified at source (Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust (LTHT) and ResearchOne) and linked using matching pseudonymous digests that are re-pseudonymised upon linkage by University of Leeds IT to produce irreversibly pseudonymous data that is processed into a research dataset. The data relates to the medical history of cancer patients prior to cancer, during their cancer diagnosis and treatment, and following their long-term outcomes, and the medical history of matched non-cancer patients that form a comparator cohort.\n\nThe data relates to 431,352 patients in the UK that LTHT have a \u2018legitimate patient relationship\u2019 with and that were determined by LTHT to have had a cancer diagnosis between 2004 and 2018 or be a matched non-cancer patient. Where available, data from ResearchOne provides primary care information for these patients. Where the patients were invited to participate in a patient reported outcomes measures survey (PROMS), this status is recorded. Where the patient returned a consented PROMS, the PROMS data will also be available once it has completed the extract, transform and load process. \n\nThe dataset is currently 5.7 GB and further ResearchOne and PROMS data is anticipated. The dataset is arranged as a relational database, with tables linking on the patient level by a pseudonymous digest. Each table is a comma separated values (CSV) file and relates to an event type, such as prescription cost, address history or diagnosis. All patients have an entry (row) in the demographics table; the number of times a patient has an entry in the other tables depends on how many events of that type were recorded for the patient. \n\nThe dataset is split into two files, each with similar table structure; the main dataset contains all patients and the PROMs dataset contains only those in the PROMs cohort (for whom additional PROMs data will be added). Each table has a re-pseudonymised digest field, \u201cDigest2\u201d and an indicator as to whether the patient has data from ResearchOne available, \u201cTPP_Linked\u201d (0 or 1). Additional fields per table are defined in Table 1. No fields contain sensitive information.\n\nContains patients in the UK that LTHT have a \u2018legitimate patient relationship\u2019 with and that were determined by LTHT to have had a cancer diagnosis between 2004 and 2018 or be a matched non-cancer patient.",

        "description": "The Scottish Birth Record is a web-based system developed on the NHSNet. It was introduced in 2002 as a replacement for SMR11. It provides the functionality to record all of a baby's neonatal care in Scotland, from antenatal through to post delivery, including readmissions and transfers in one electronic record. SBR is based on individuals and events rather than episodes and is completed for all births including stillbirths and home births. The system has been implemented to varying degrees (either directly or indirectly via interfaces with existing hospital systems) in all Scottish hospitals providing midwifery and/or neonatal care. A CHI number is generated soon after a baby is born in order to minimise the chances of a baby being lost on the database through a change of name after birth. The SBR collects a wide variety of information on the child from birth and during the baby's first year of life, with up to four hundred data items recorded for any one individual. This includes gestation, weight, congenital anomalies and discharge details. Identifiers such as name, date of birth, Community Health Index number and postcode are also included.",

UHB provides secondary care to a population of 1.3 million in Birmingham and Solihull, provides a full range of tertiary services to the WM region, and collated all regional 100K patient data, leading the regional response.    \n\nGenomics England was set up to deliver the flagship 100,000 genome project and sequence 100,000 whole genomes from NHS patients, something that at the time no one in the world had attempted. Its four main aims were; to create an ethical and transparent programme based on consent; to bring benefit to patients and set up a genomic medicine service for the NHS; to enable new scientific discovery and medical insights; and to kick start the development of a UK genomics industry.\n\nThis dataset focuses on patients with a rare disease and their families and patients with cancer. At least 80 percent of rare diseases are genomic with half of new cases found in children. Knowledge of the whole genome sequence has helped to identify the cause of some rare diseases and help point the way to new treatments for these devastating conditions.  Cancers within this registry include breast cancers, colorectal cancers, glioma, and haematological cancers, as well as others.  Cancer datasets are linked to digital pathology and both cancer and rare disease datasets are linked to genomic and imaging data as well as highly granular hospital episode data which form the fully electronic health record at UHB. To this dataset, PIONEER brings the acute care contacts of these patients, including acute service utilisation. \n\nThe dataset schema includes:\nDemographic Information (Year of Birth, Gender, Height, Weight, Postcode, Ethnicity, Socioeconomic status) Co and multi-morbidity.  Data includes admission dates, presenting symptoms, data of care process and provision including serial physiological and laboratory measurements (Blood pressure, Pulse, Oxygenation, Respiratory Rate, Blood Sugar), Haematology, Biochemistry and Point of Care Blood Gas analysis), Serial acuity scores (NEWS2), serial investigations, interventions and treatments and outcome (all date and time stamped).  The 100K Genome data includes digital pathology, imaging and hospital outpatient records, longitudinally since 2000 in some instances.\n\nThe data is hosted within the PIONEER Data haven, a trusted research environment (TRE) facilitating remote access to health and administrative data.",

In July 2010 the A&E data mart was extended further to collect items such as diagnosis, several injury fields and an alcohol involved flag, which will be used to identify whether the patient\u2019s alcohol consumption was a factor in the attendance. The collection of the new fields has been driven by a variety of SG policy decisions and interest from a number of organisations. Although there is now the facility to submit these additional fields, they are still under development and ISD are working with the NHS Boards to support data collection and quality. There are two types of data submitted to the A&E datamart: episode and aggregate level data. All hospitals with Emergency Departments submit episode level data containing a detailed record for each patient attendance. Some smaller sites with minor injury units or community hospitals only submit aggregate files containing monthly summary attendance and compliance figures only. This is because they do not have the information systems and support to enable collection of detailed patient based information. Sites that submit episode level data account for around 94% of all attendances at A&E.",

        "description": "We aim to develop and refine a mobile application for asthma self-management which tailored to health literacy needs for adults patients with asthma in primary care clinic in the Klang District, Selangor State, Malaysia. Dataset contains qualitative interviews from phase 2, responses to quantitative questionnaire and qualitative interviews in phase 3. \n\nSupported self-management for asthma (including action plans and regular review) is highly effective at improving asthma control, reducing acute attacks and the need for unscheduled healthcare. However, globally it is challenging to implement self-management in patients with asthma. One particular challenge is the need to tailor support for people with limited health literacy especially in low and middle income countries (LMICs) such as in Malaysia. In 2015,  it was estimated that more than 90% of the Malaysian general population have limited health literacy. A tailored asthma self-management intervention, paying attention to the needs of people with limited health literacy, potentially could lessen health inequalities in Malaysia. This study is conducted in 3 phases. Phase 1 is a systematic review looking at effectiveness of asthma self-management interventions which address health literacy needs. We found gap in this area of knowledge. In phase 2, we conducted mixed qualitative and Photovoice, an arts-based qualitative study to explore lived experience of people living with asthma and limited health literacy in Malaysia. We found rich data on challenges and enablers around psychosocial themes on how people views asthma, self-management and experienced health literacy.  We also explore the potential of technology i.e. mobile application to tailor asthma self-management support. Based on phase 2 findings, in phase 3, we developed and refined an asthma self-management mobile application with feedback from patients and health care professionals through a intervention design workshop which was conducted online. \n\nFor further information, see:\nhttps://www.ed.ac.uk/usher/respire/phd-studentships/hani-salim\nhttps://www.ed.ac.uk/usher/respire/health-literacy-asthma-malaysia           \n\nPhase 1: Salim, H., Young, I., Shariff Ghazali, S. et al.

        "description": "This is the bioresource resulting from the United Kingdom Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS), one of the world's largest randomised controlled trials. Between 2001-2005 1.2 million women aged 50-74 years were invited from the general population and 202,638 post-menopausal were randomised (2:1:1) to routine care, or annual CA125 blood testing (7-11 rounds) or ultrasound to evaluate the impact of ovarian cancer screening on disease mortality. All participants provided a serum sample at recruitment with 50,262 providing further longitudinal annual samples (median of 9 samples). Women were free of any active malignancy at enrolment (2001-2005). During the follow-up period of >15 years to-date a proportion of those have subsequently developed a number of different diseases. Available comprehensive electronic health record linkage of the cohort's participants (including Hospital Episode Statistics (HES); ONS (Cancer registry, Death Certificates); National Cancer Intelligence Network (NCIN); and Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP) allows exploiting clinical phenotyping and diseases diagnoses made during routine healthcare in the NHS. Women were also sent postal questionnaires. Secondary studies have to date generated additional data on symptoms, menopause and its management and further details of individual cancers. \nThe biobank contains >540,000 high-quality serum samples (10 x 500\u00ce\u00bcL aliquots in straws), composed of baseline (from >189,000 women) and a unique longitudinal set of >350,000 annual serial samples (median 9) (from approximately 50,200 women). Samples have already been validated for multi-omics analysis with academic and commercial collaborators in nested case/controls sets used for genotyping, proteomics (including SWATH technology), methylation, NMR metabolomics, autoantibody profiling, ELISA-based assays, lipidomics and miRNA.\nWe provide access to collection of samples and data across the following diseases: \n\u2022\tCerebrovascular accident (disorder)\n\u2022\tDementia (disorder)\n\u2022\tFit and well\n\u2022\tHeart disease (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant neoplasm of endometrium of corpus uteri (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of breast, Malignant tumour of colon, Malignant tumour of lung, Malignant tumour of ovary\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of pancreas\nAll data is stored in the IG Toolkit-compliant and ISO 27001:2013-certified UCL Data Safe Haven.\nAll samples from the biobank have been collected using a standardised protocol and stored in liquid nitrogen at HTA licensed facilities at UK Biocentre, Oxford, UK.",

It intends to extend recruitment in all areas, and to other rare and common disease groups, with a target of ~300k by 2022. The NIHR BioResource acquires contact details - name, address, email address, phone/mobile number - from participants at recruitment.  This is used to recontact participants to invite them to take part in experimental medicine studies, although sample-only and data-only studies are permitted.  We also record NHS number, where known, to allow linkage to healthcare records. Recruitment takes place at blood donor centres, disease clinics, online (particularly for the Mental Health BioResource) but also from more public settings. A participant is not considered a member of the NIHR BioResource without contact details. NHS number availability depends on recruitment method: blood donors and those recruited through clinics will have these to hand, general members of the public will not.",

        "description": "The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) nationally representative general practice sentinel network and database\nNational primary care sentinel network:\nThe RCGP RSC is nationally representative a network of over 500 general practices (GP) providing pseudonymised data for weekly surveillance of infectious diseases; our data are also available for quality improvement, research and education.  Research based on the RCGP RSC data have been published in the best journals including BMJ, Lancet and Diabetes Care.\nObservational research\nThe disease surveillance program is commissioned by Public Health England (PHE) and covers 37 infectious diseases including influenza. The RCGP RSC is a nationally representative population.  The RCGP RSC and PHE, and its predecessor organizations have an over 50-year history of collaboration in influenza and respiratory disease surveillance and vaccine effectiveness studies.  Each practice in the network is reported on by all 37 infectious disease on a weekly basis and are graphically compared with the network as a whole (on their own web based dashboard); this drives both quality improvement in clinical care and also raises data quality, with our practice liaison team providing timely support to practices requiring help with any disparities in their information.  Thus, the observational researcher benefits from a data warehouse of patient level records going back decades with consistently coded data, able to support both longitudinal and cross-sectional study designs.\nInterventional research \u2013 ambition to be a hub for trials \nThe RCGP RSC has produced a \u2018Weekly Return\u2019 of infections and respiratory disease since 1967, though over time it has expanded in terms of size, scope, sample collection and its capability with linking with other datasets. The databases systems at the RCGP RSC can process large numbers of patients\u2019 data rapidly. The typical duration for generating the weekly report is under 4 hours. The weekly report reached its highest denominator of 3 million patients in last week of October 2019.\nThe RCGP RSC hosts Workload Observatory (funded by NHS England) for GPs to understand trends of patients with multiple and more complex conditions. Using disease specific dashboards, general practices are provided weekly updated data quality indicators and comparison with other practices in the RCGP RSC network. This process allows practices to continuously improve their data quality and increase the quality of the RCGP RSC studies over time.\nWe regularly administer questionnaires in our studies and are experienced in collecting samples from our network of practices.  Practice level support from our dedicated practice liaison team is enhanced by our suite of dashboard technologies delivering rapid feedback to each of our practices. Hence combing our expertise in real world data analysis, high frequency of practice support and our continual development of internet-based practice level interaction, we are well placed for providing a low cost pragmatic trials platform for quality improvement studies or as a medicinal trials platform. \n\nClinical concepts are ontologically defined for clinical concepts as part of developing a study protocol.  We have clinical and programming expertise to assist researchers in developing new ontologies for case finding and have a pool of existing ontologies and associated computer algorithms for extracting the data.  \n\n\nWe have ongoing research across a wide range of medical areas, with international collaborations in child health, diabetes and influenza vaccination and have an extensive set of data extraction, processing and analytic procedures we have developed which are readily available to existing and new research collaborators.",

        "description": "Chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) in low resource settings are neglected and often poorly diagnosed, leading to missed opportunities for early initiation of treatment and poor patient pathways. For example, in India, lung cancer often emerges on a background of chronic respiratory symptoms and is often not diagnosed at all \u2013 or at a very late stage. Because of late presentation and a range of other factors, survival from lung cancer in India is very low. At present we know very little about how knowledge and attitudes relating to CRD in poor, rural populations in India might be influenced by health and behavioural interventions. Similarly, compliance with treatments offered is poorly understood. Psychological theory-based interventions must be culturally appropriate and grounded in the local context. As such, it\u2019s vital we develop our understanding if we are to change behaviours and reduce exposure to common risk factors, such as smoking and indoor cooking smoke.                         \n\nThe project will determine the feasibility of an intervention study of Health Care Worker (HCW)-delivered respiratory package including health education drawing on psychological theory of planned behaviour in the intervention arm and Health Belief Model in control arm and delivery of treatment and follow-up. \n\nFor further information, see: https://www.ed.ac.uk/usher/respire/chronic-respiratory-disorders/adult-lung-disease",

        "description": "More than 40% of all pregnant women in Pakistan are exposed to second-hand smoke (SHS) \u2013 causing approximately 17,000 still births in a year. SHS exposure in non-smoking pregnant women has increased the risk of stillbirth and congenital malformation along with behavioral and cognitive issues in children. Partner\u2019s support during pregnancy is important for developing a better maternal health. Therefore, an evidence-informed conceptual framework will be developed to propose a behaviour change communication intervention, which will target poor or risky behaviors to promote behaviour modification that may result in positive maternal and fetal health outcomes. This will be a qualitative study incorporating an initial stage of systematic review followed by formative research.\n\nFor further information, see: https://www.ed.ac.uk/usher/respire/acute-respiratory-disorders/second-hand-smoke",

        "description": "This dataset covers 78% of the population of Wales and is linkable with anonymised fields for individuals and GPs to other datasets, including bespoke project specific cohorts. Each GP practice uses a clinical information system to maintain an electronic health record for each of their patients; capturing the signs, symptoms, test results, diagnoses, prescribed treatment, referrals for specialist treatment and social aspects relating to the patients home environment.\n\n\nThe majority of the data is entered by the clinician during the patient consultation. Test results are electronically transferred from secondary care systems.\n\nThere are no standard rules for recording data within primary care clinical information systems. Therefore, each individual clinician can record information in their own way. The majority use Read Code Terminology, however, sometimes this is applied behind the scenes by the clinical system and sometimes local codes are used. Read codes are not as precise as ICD 10 or OPCS codes.\n\nCoding standards have been agreed on for conditions monitored by the QOF (Quality Outcomes Framework) returns. Since the implementation of QOF these conditions have been coded in a more consistent way.\n\nTime coverage varies between each practice.",

GMCs recruit and consent patients. They then provide DNA samples and clinical information for analysis.\n\nIllumina, a biotechnology company, have been commissioned to sequence the DNA of participants. They return the whole genome sequences to Genomics England. We have created a secure, monitored, infrastructure to store the genome sequences and clinical data. The data is analysed within this infrastructure and any important findings, like a diagnosis, are passed back to the patient\u2019s doctor.\n\nTo help make sure that the project brings benefits for people who take part, we have created the Genomics England Clinical Interpretation Partnership (GeCIP). GeCIP brings together funders, researchers, NHS teams and trainees. They will analyse the data \u2013 to help ensure benefits for patients and an increased understanding of genomics. The data will also be used for medical and scientific research. This could be research into diagnosing, understanding or treating disease.\n\nFind out more\n\nTo learn more about how we work you can read the 100,000 Genomes Project protocol. It has details of the development, delivery and operation of the project. It also sets out the patient and clinical benefit, scientific and transformational objectives, the implementation strategy and the ethical and governance frameworks.",

These samples are available for research into MND and associated conditions such as fronto-temporal dementia only.\nThe UK MND Collections combines more than 3,000 biological samples and accompanying clinical information; as well as epidemiology data from 400 participants, including people with MND, controls and family members.\nThe DNA Bank was the original Collection of whole genome DNA from over 3,000 blood samples, which are stored at CIGMR (Centre for Integrated Genomic Medical Research) in Manchester, UK. The DNA Bank also has clinical information (divided into a minimum and extended dataset) which is available to researchers.\nThe Cell Lines Collection offers a sub set of the DNA Bank samples as EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes. This was originally set up as an everlasting supply of DNA, with the lymphoblastoid cell lines now available to researchers to help them understand how the disease is developing.\nThe Epidemiology Collection has just over 200 patient and matched control blood samples with extensive environmental and lifestyle data (both from self-report questionnaires and telephone interviews) available to researchers.\nMore information on the DNA and cell bank is available in Smith et al BMC Genetics (2015) 16:84.",

The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of cediranib by measuring the percentage change in the sum of target marker lesion diameters from randomisation to week 24 compared to placebo. Secondary objectives include: progression-free survival, overall survival and safety and tolerability of cediranib in ASPS patients. Tissue markers of tumour response, circulating markers of angiogenesis, and changes in circulating endothelial cells/precursor cells in response to cediranib will be explored.  Thirty six patients with progressive, metastatic, histologically confirmed ASPS will be recruited. Patients will be randomised to 24 weeks of blinded cediranib or placebo, after which treatment will be unblinded and all patients offered open-label cediranib until objective disease progression, or death if sooner.",

        "description": "Background:\nThe Leeds Biobanking and Sample Processing Lab (LBSPL) is based at St James's University Hospital and is an important element in the Leeds Clinical Research Facility (LCRF). LBSPL is dedicated to providing a sample processing service for clinical trials, and for many biobanking activities within the University and Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust.  These currently include collections of tissue, and fluid samples such as blood and urine obtained from consented patients diagnosed with kidney, bladder, colorectal and ovarian cancer, brain tumours, and patients undergoing renal transplant. These are processed and stored in research tissue banks (Leeds Multidisciplinary RTB and Leeds NIHR Biomarker RTB) and used as a valuable resource for wider research activities.\nThe Leeds Multidisciplinary Research Tissue Bank (RTB) was given favourable ethical opinion by the Leeds (East) Research Ethics Committee on 3rd March 2010 and renewed 5 years later (Current REC ref: 15/YH/0080).  \n\nCurrent situation:\nThe LBSPL provides ongoing sample processing support to a variety of local or commercial clinical trials requiring samples to be collected for PK/PD endpoints or other associated translational studies. The Leeds Multidisciplinary RTB currently holds matched normal and malignant frozen renal tissue samples from ~600 patients with renal cancer, and plasma, serum, buffy coat and urine samples from ~800 renal cancer patients either prior to surgery/treatment or during treatment, for example with sunitinib. In addition, fluid samples have been collected from patients with benign urological conditions, healthy controls, patients prior to and following renal transplant A population-based TMA including tissue from ~300 RCC patients has also been established. From having solely a renal focus, the RTB has expanded to now also include frozen normal tissue samples, and frozen tissue and urine samples from >1,000 patients with bladder cancer, frozen tissue from patients with brain tumours and limited samples from patients with ovarian cancer or colorectal cancer (no new collections ongoing in these areas). The Leeds NIHR BioRTB has closed to recruitment and contains a bank of fluid samples from patients with liver disease, renal cancer and patient undergoing renal transplantation. These were collected as part of a multicentre initiative in the UK, together with associated clinical data, and are intended for use in biomarker validation studies.  \n\nSample processing and clinical data:\nSamples are processed according to the relevant quality controlled Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) within Good Clinical Practice (GCLP) laboratories. The dedicated sample processing team of laboratory technicians, administrative staff and a Quality Assurance manager works together to ensure that all samples are handled, processed, stored and tracked to the highest standards. The samples are stored accordingly at the correct temperature (e.g. snap frozen tissue in liquid nitrogen, plasma, serum and buffy coats at -80oC). All freezers and liquid nitrogen dewars which hold patient samples are monitored using the Tutela system, a 24/7 web-based alert response temperature monitoring system.\nFull clinical data is being collected using CRFs. Follow-up data and data available later such as pathology results are obtained from the relevant hospital records/databases by trained personnel with appropriate access. We hope to move to more automated data linkage in the future through working with the Leeds Institute of Data Analytics.  \nTo find further information about collaborative access to these RTB samples please e-mail Roz Banks or Jo Brown at rtb@leeds.ac.uk.",

In addition, participants are empowered to contact the study direct to express their preferences. The primary use of consent records is as an exclusion when participants are invited to take part in experimental medicine studies.  However consent is also factored in to the release of samples and data for sample-only and data-only studies.  One implication, is that data releases have freezes that capture a snapshot of the current consent statuses.

Procedures that are postponed one or more times during the same admitted stay and not performed during that stay should be reported as one postponement. Procedures that are postponed twice for the same intended admission date should be counted as one postponement. Procedures that are postponed but are subsequently rescheduled and performed during the same admitted stay are excluded. Patients whose procedures were scheduled to take place outside Wales are excluded. Local Health Boards are required to submit data on Welsh residents whose procedures are intended to take place in their Local Health Board. For example, if a patient is on a waiting list in Cardiff University Health Board but are sent to Cwm Taf to have their procedure (waiting list initiative). Cwm Taf schedule the intended admission date and subsequently postpone the procedure, the postponement should be submitted by Cwm Taf. Velindre NHS Trust are excluded.\n\nFormerly known as Cancelled Admitted Procedures Dataset.",

The collection is stored and maintained by the Seroepidemiology Unit (SEU) at the Public Health Laboratory (PHL), Manchester. \nSera submitted to the SEU are residues of specimens submitted for diagnostic testing.  They sample the population range and are anonymised prior to archiving (retaining age, sex, date of collection and source laboratory only). Collection of sera is continuing through collaboration with the PHE Microbiology Services Division (MSD) and some NHS laboratories throughout England, and has occurred annually since 1986.  Over 230,000 sera are now stored and catalogued. The collection can be made available for testing to anyone wishing to use it to address issues related to public health policy.",

The survey measured the overall quality of life of representative samples of cancer survivors with breast, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL) diagnosed during July 2006 - July 2010. Quality of life was assessed at four different time points after diagnosis at approximately one, two, three or five years. As this was a pilot survey, numbers are small and data governance issues will need to be carefully considered on a study by study basis.

It intends to extend recruitment in all areas, and to other rare and common disease groups, with a target of ~300k by 2022. The NIHR BioResource acquires samples at recruitment for each participant recruited. With the exception of the GLAD study, which posts saliva kits direct to participants\u2019 homes, the preferred sample collection is 3 blood tubes \u2013 see https://bioresourcesupport.org.uk/live-samples/ - from which DNA can be extracted, and plasma and sera stored.  In many clinics, the NIHR BioResource blood draw follows immediately the blood collection for routine healthcare purposes.  In the case of children, less blood will be taken, down to 1mL. The Technical Metadata describes the standard used by RD-Connect, the EU-wide Rare Disease biobank consortium - https://samples.rd-connect.eu/menu/main/home. During 2020, this will be replaced by an API from the UK CRC Tissue Directory, as using this discovery tool is a condition of running a Research Tissue Bank in the UK.",

        "description": "ALSPAC was established to understand how genetic, biological, environmental, social, psychological and psychosocial factors influence the health and development of children and their parents. ALSPAC is a multi-generation prospective cohort based in Bristol in the South West of England. More than 14,000 women (G0) were enrolled in 1991 and 1992. Their partners (also G0), children (G1) and now grandchildren (G2) have been recruited and followed up over multiple timepoints. A wide variety of biological samples have been collected along with a vast array of exposure and outcome data collected via questionnaire, face to face clinics and through linkage to administrative data.\n\nDuring the index pregnancy women were sent 3 questionnaires. Since then, over a period of some 25 years, women have been sent almost annual questionnaires asking about their own health and well-being. From 2008, women were invited to attend four focus clinical assessments. Assessments of the children have been administered frequently, with multiple data collection time points since birth. These include numerous child-completed questionnaires, a number of clinical assessments from the age of 7 years and further questionnaires about the child completed by the mother or other main caregiver. Partners of the mothers have also completed a number of questionnaires and been invited to one focus clinic assessment. The second generation (children of the children) have been and continue to be recruited with data collected via questionnaire and clinical assessment at multiple time points.\n\nDataset has multiple releases (not scheduled)",

Haemato-oncology samples are stored at presentation and throughout the disease course, including at remission and relapse. In addition CEHRB stores haemato-oncology and oncology samples which are specifically taken for the biobank, usually in response to a specific project.\nCEHRB is housed within the WMRGL which is accredited by United Kingdom Accreditation Services to ISO15189:2012. The WMRGL serves a population of about 6 million and is the largest UK NHS genetics lab. Due to the large patient population CEHRB is able to collate sufficient research material from all classifications of neoplastic haematological disorders including those that are rare.",

        "description": "Whereas most of the evidence generated from the start of the global pandemic, COVID-19, focuses on epidemiological, diagnostic and clinical aspects of the illness, importance of social aspects has also been highlighted. This has been included as one of the 34 knowledge gaps specified in the WHO R&D Blueprint WHO 2019 Novel Coronavirus Global research and innovation forum: towards a research roadmap published recently. One of the key approaches to containing COVID-19 has been self-quarantine and social distancing, which although is the need of the day but not easy to manage posing multiple challenges especially in a Pakistani community which follows strong cultural and social beliefs. It is, therefore important to identify the perception, practice and attitude of the community towards containing this disease. These insights are important for national health officials planning to implement control measures in an existing diverse socio-cultural system, an aspect which has been highlighted in the National Action Plan (NAP) for COVID-19 in Pakistan, published on 13th March 2020.\n\nFor further information, see: https://www.ed.ac.uk/usher/respire/covid-19/community-perception-public-health-measures",

Participants are individuals who have consented to be part of the project with the expectation that a sample of their DNA will be obtained and their genome sequenced. Pedigree members are extended members of the proband\u2019s family, this includes participants as well a small amounts of deidentified data recorded to allow a full picture of the proband\u2019s extended family. This additional information is extracted from the proband\u2019s medical record.\n\nAll Rare Disease table names are prefixed with \u201crare_diseases_\u201d.\n\nData at the Level of Rare Disease Families:\n\nrare_diseases_family:\n\nData describing the families of rare disease probands participating in the 100,000 Genomes Project. It includes the family group type, the status of the family\u2019s pre-interpretation clinical review and the settings that were chosen for the interpretation pipeline at the clinical review.\n\nrare_diseases_pedigree:\n\nData describing the Rare Disease participants, linking pedigrees to probands and their family members.\n\nrare_diseases_pedigree_member:\n\nData describing the Rare Disease pedigree members, similar to the data about each individual participant in the participant table (common data view, see section 8.2). It may also include additional data, such as the age of onset of predominant clinical features; data on links to other family members; as well as data collected only for Phenotypes.\n\nData at the Level of Rare Disease Participants.\n\nThe data presented in these tables provides information on disease progression and pertinent medical history:\n\nrare_diseases_participant_disease:\n\nData describing the rare disease participants' disease type/subtype assigned to them upon enrolment, and the date of diagnosis.\n\nrare_diseases_participant_phenotype:\n\nData describing the Rare Disease participants\u2019 phenotypes. For each Rare Disease participant in the 100,000 Genomes Project, there are data about whether a phenotypic abnormality as defined by an HPO term is present and what the HPO term is, as well as the age of onset, the severity of manifestation, the spatial pattern in the body and whether it is progressive or not. Please note that these data are only available for a subset of the rare disease participants.\n\nrare_diseases_gen_measurement:\n\nFor Rare Disease participants in the 100,000 Genomes Project, this table contains general measurements relevant to the disease, alongside the date that the measurements were taken on.

The latest census was held on Sunday 27 March 2011.\n\nEvery effort is made to include everyone, and that is why the census is so important. It is the only survey which provides a detailed picture of the entire population, and is unique because it covers everyone at the same time and asks the same core questions everywhere. This makes it easy to compare different parts of the country.\n\nThe information the census provides allows central and local government, health authorities and many other organisations to target their resources more effectively and to plan housing, education, health and transport services for years to come.\n\nIn England and Wales, the census is planned and carried out by the Office for National Statistics. Elsewhere in the UK, responsibility lies with the National Records of Scotland and the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency.\"",

This was achieved by establishing a biorepository and clinical research database. The biorepository is housed in the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, directed by Dr John McLauchlan and managed by Dr Sarah McDonald. Samples have been obtained from around 10,000 patients.\nAccess to samples and data is governed by a Tissue and Data Access Committee (TDAC). These are reviewed for ethical and scientific merit by TDAC and a decision reached. \nSerum and plasma are obtained from all patients in the cohort. Buffy coats are also collected, and DNA can be extracted when required. Additionally, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and PAX gene tubes are held for smaller cohorts of patients. The extensive clinical data collected complements the biorepository and allows selection of samples from patients with characteristics of interest.\nSub-cohorts:\n-\tSerial samples from patients who were treated as part of the NHS England Early Access Program.\n-\tYearly samples from cirrhotic patients (beginning 2015)\n-\tSpontaneous resolvers\n-\tSmall paediatric cohort\nClinical Data\n-\tBasic demographics including place of birth and ethnicity\n-\tHistory of HCV infection including exposure to risk factors and dates\n-\tDate of diagnosis, date of first attendance at clinic\n-\tCo-morbidities and co-medications at time of enrolment\n-\tLiver disease status and how diagnosed\n-\tTreatment status at enrolment; \n-\tSocial history including alcohol, cigarettes, cannabis; BMI\n-\tHCV RNA status, viral load and genotype/subtype\n-\tHistorical data from the patients' notes regarding previous treatment episodes (dates, regimen, viral loads, outcome) and liver biopsies\n-\tLaboratory data including imaging and fibroscan;\n-\tNew treatment episodes and changes in liver disease status are recorded over time, as are any newly developed co-morbidities.\nAll data generated by researchers who access our biorepository must be returned into the database. Over time this will include host genetics, full length viral sequences, immunophenotyping and biomarker studies.",

        "description": "A regional asset for Yorkshire and Humber Data, a population-based database of all children and young people (0\u201329 years) diagnosed with cancer residing in the Yorkshire and Humber region in England (10,000 tumour registrations in children aged 0-14 years since 1974 and Adolescents and Young Adults aged 15-29 years since 1990). The database contains detailed information on clinical prognostic factors including detailed treatment and stage information. A unique quality of the Yorkshire Register is that it has pre-linked data with hospital admissions datasets including inpatient, outpatient, A&E, Mental Health HES which has been used to explore long-term morbidity in the cohort. Primary care linked data have been requested and are pending. Linked educational attainment and unemployment/social benefits data are currently being sought (ethical approval in place). Demand is largely underpinned by ongoing epidemiological and cancer\noutcomes requests from University postgraduate researchers, PGT students, and other children\u2019s tumour registers. However, pharma has also requested some of the registry data. Ethics and Research Governance are all current, the former approved as a Research Database by the Northern & Yorkshire MREC (Ref MREC 0/3/1) from which data can be requested by external researchers, and approval from the Health Research Authority Confidentiality Advisory Group to process identifiable patient data without consent (Ref\u2014CAG 1-07(b)/2014). The Register goes beyond the dataset held by NCRAS in having much more rich and detailed treatment histories of every patient through active follow-up so beyond the traditional 6-month window since diagnosis used by NCRAS, as well as more complete tumour staging information. Register also records any cancer recurrence alongside any subsequent treatment received. \n\nThe Yorkshire Specialist Register of Cancer in Children and Young People exists primarily to underpin epidemiological research examining the patterns and causes of cancer in children and young people and to facilitate health services research describing the patient experience in the context of care received by health professionals. The YSRCCYP is an established information resource for local clinicians and commissioners, and forms the basis for national and international collaborative research.\nThe core aims of the YSRCCYP are to:\n\u2022\tMaintain the accurate and complete collection of clinical and socio-demographic data on children, teenagers and young adults with cancer in Yorkshire, specifically information not otherwise available from other routine NHS sources.\n\u2022\tInvestigate the effectiveness of healthcare delivery for children and young people, specifically the impact on survival and long-term health.\n\u2022\tUndertake epidemiological research, comprising incidence and survival analyses.\n\u2022\tDescribe environmental risk factors for childhood and young adult cancer.\n\nExample of three recent research studies by the Yorkshire Register research team are as follows:\n\n1. Respiratory morbidity in young people surviving cancer: Population based study of hospital admissions, treatment related risk factors and subsequent mortality\n(Smith et al, 2019)\n\nRespiratory diseases are a major cause of late morbidity and mortality amongst childhood cancer survivors. This population-based study provides comprehensive analysis of hospitalisations for respiratory conditions, the associated risks of admission by earlier cancer treatment and trends in readmissions and subsequent mortality in long-term survivors of cancers diagnosed under 30 years. The risk of hospitalisation was significantly higher in cancer survivors compared to the general population. Treatment with chemotherapy with known lung toxicity was associated with an increased risk of admissions for all respiratory disease especially pneumonia. Subsequent mortality was highest in those admitted for pneumonia compared to other respiratory conditions.\n\n2. Long term survival after childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: population-based trends in cure and relapse by clinical characteristics\n(Smith et al, 2018)\n\nStatistical \u201ccure models\u201d provide additional metrics useful to identify and describe trends in survival. Additional measures include the proportion cured which is a summary of the long term survival and the median survival of the uncured which give information on those who are not long-term survivors. In this study we used a statistical cure model to explore trends in long-term survival and relapse for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) over time and by clinical characteristics. The proportion of patients cured, defined either by overall survival or relapse free survival, has increased over time while there was slight decrease in the median survival time of the uncured. We also observed a significant reduction in the risk of relapse over time.\n\n3. Comparison of ethnic group classification using naming analysis and routinely collected data\n(Smith et al, 2017)\n\nIn this study we compared cancer incidence trends using different methods for assigning ethnic groups to individuals: 1 \u2013 using ethnic group recorded in hospital medical records, 2 \u2013 using a naming software program to assign an ethnic group based on the ethnic origins of the individuals and 3 \u2013 using a combination of both processes. We found that using different methods of assigning ethnicity can result in different estimates of ethnic variation in cancer incidence. Combining ethnicity from multiple sources results in a more complete estimate of ethnicity than the use of one single source.\n\nhttps://medicinehealth.leeds.ac.uk/leeds-institute-cardiovascular-metabolic-medicine/doc/yorkshire-specialist-register-cancer-children-young-people",

Its aim is to establish a large, comprehensive biobank comprising tumour tissue, blood and serial plasma samples with associated clinical data which will be an invaluable resource for high-quality translational research in ovarian cancer. \nICON8 is a phase III randomised controlled trial designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of two dose-dense, dose-fractionated, weekly carboplatin-paclitaxel combination chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of newly diagnosed ovarian cancer compared to standard three-weekly carboplatin-paclitaxel. There is a growing body of evidence that using dose-fractionated paclitaxel in particular may have increased anti-tumour effects, and this is thought to be due to enhanced anti-angiogenic and pro-apoptotic effects.",

        "description": "The ever evolving role of ASHA demands an up-to-date comprehensive assessment of the workload, incentives and understanding of the work profile from the perspectives of the health system, community and ASHA herself in order to guide successful future implementation as well as sustainability of the programme. This study had a broad interest in both the full range of tasks and the different situations in which ASHA work and the changing context in which their role is interpreted. This study therefore used a mixed-methods approach to assess and explore ASHAs\u2019 perspectives of their workload alongside that of local healthcare colleagues in both rural and village contexts.\n\nBackground: \nGlobally, Community Health Workers (CHWs) are integral contributors to many health systems. In India, Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) have been deployed since 2005. Engaged in multiple health care activities, they are a key link between the health system and population. ASHAs are expected to participate in new health programmes, prompting interest in their current workload from the perspective of the health system, community and their family.   \n  \nMethods: \nThis mixed methods design study was conducted in rural and tribal Primary Health Centers (PHCs), in Pune district, Western Maharashtra, India. All ASHAs affiliated with these PHCs were invited to participate in the quantitative study, those agreeing to contribute in-depth interviews (IDI) were enrolled in an additional qualitative study. Key informants\u2019 interviews  were conducted with the Auxiliary Nurse Midwife, Block Facilitators and Medical Officers of the same PHCs. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data were analysed thematically.\n\nResults: \nWe recruited 67 ASHAs from the two PHCs.  ASHAs worked up to 20 hours/week in their village of residence, serving populations of  approximately 800-1200, embracing an increasing range of activities, despite a workload that contributed to feelings of being rushed and constant tiredness. They juggled household work, other paid  jobs and their ASHA activities. Practical problems with travel added to time involved, especially in tribal areas where transport is lacking. Their sense of benefiting the community and respect and recognition in village brought happiness and job satisfaction. They were willing to take on new tasks. ASHAs perceived themselves as voluntary community health workers rather than as \"health activists.\"\n\nConclusions:\nASHAs were struggling to balance their significant ASHA workload, and domestic tasks. They were proud of their role as CHWs and willing to take on new activities. Strategies to recruit, train, enhance skills, incentivise, and retain ASHAs, need to be prioritised. Evolving attitudes to the advantages/disadvantages of the current voluntary status of ASHAs need to be understood and addressed in terms of working arrangements if ASHAs are to be remain a key component in achieving universal health coverage.\n\nFor full details, see: https://www.ed.ac.uk/usher/respire/chronic-respiratory-disorders/asha-workload",

This work can only continue to progress if there is accurate and complete information about the people who are developing cancer. This information is collected through a process called cancer registration.\n\nCancer registration is the systematic collection of data about cancer and tumour diseases. In England, this data collection is managed by NCRAS. Every year, NCRAS collects information on over 300,000 cases of cancer, including patient details (including their name, address, age, sex, and date of birth), as well as detailed data about the type of cancer, how advanced it is and the treatment the patient receives.\n\nSo NCRAS can identify every cancer and ensure complete case ascertainment, it uses a wide range of data sources. These include data sent to NCRAS from:\n\nhistopathology and haematology services\nmedical records\nradiotherapy departments\nhospices\nindependent hospitals\nscreening services\ndeath certificates\nGPs\nother UK cancer registries\n\nBy obtaining data from multiple sources and then matching and merging them as required, NCRAS can build a complete picture of the incidence and prevalence of cancer in England, as well as understanding how cancer patients are diagnosed, treated and their outcomes.\n\nNCRAS also link this information to other health information routinely collected by the NHS (such as information on attendances in hospital) and patient experience surveys, such as Patient Reported Outcome Measures and the National Cancer Patient Experience Survey.",

Data are linked via Lower Super Output Area (LSOA), Super Output Area (SOA) in Northern Ireland and datazone (DZ) in Scotland. The latest available patient postcode of residence is mapped to an LSOA boundary. The LSOA of residence then allows linkage to the following LSOA-level deprivation measures:\n2004 English Index of Multiple Deprivation; 2007 English Index of Multiple Deprivation; 2010 English Index of Multiple Deprivation; 2015 English Index of Multiple Deprivation (composite and individual domains); Townsend Deprivation Index: calculated using unadjusted 2001 census data; Carstairs Index using 2011 census data.\n\nData are provided as quintiles, deciles or twentiles of the deprivation score to prevent disclosure of patient location. In order to prevent the possibility of deductive disclosure of a patients\u2019 area of residence, researchers will only be provided with one of the above linked datasets for any one study.",

        "description": "The Wales Cancer Bank (WCB) was set up in 2004 and consented the first patient in 2005. The project is hosted by Cardiff University and receives funding from the Welsh Government, Cancer Research Wales and Velindre Charitable funds.\nA Cancer Bank is literally a collection of tissue and blood which has been collected from patients where cancer is a possible diagnosis and is being stored to facilitate future research into cancer.\nStatistics suggest that four out of ten people will be diagnosed with cancer at some point during their life. Cancers are complex diseases and it is an on-going quest to understand how they develop, spread and can be treated. The development of more effective, targeted treatment for cancer depends on increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the initiation of the tumour, its progression to metastatic disease and response and resistance to treatment. Research studies rely on the availability of high quality biological material from patients with cancer and large studies are needed to correlate biology with clinical outcome.\nThe Welsh population is relatively stable and this makes it an ideal cohort to collect and study. Linkage with the all Wales cancer clinical database (CANISC) enables good correlation of science with clinical follow-up. This will eventually enable the results from hundreds of research projects to be integrated and linked to clinical outcome and this will be an invaluable source of data for bioinformatics specialists to examine. All the data collected is being stored on a database housed in the NHS to ensure security and confidentiality.\nThe WCB currently consents patients in 12 hospitals around Wales with specially trained research nurses and clinical teams.\nWe provide access to collection of samples and data across the following diseases: \n\u2022\tHodgkin's disease (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant neoplasm of connective tissue (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant neoplasm of endometrium of corpus uteri (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant neoplasm of skin\n\u2022\tMalignant neoplasm of upper respiratory tract (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of adrenal gland (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of anal canal (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of biliary tract (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of cervix\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of kidney (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of nasal sinuses (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of oral cavity (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of penis (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of prostate (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of salivary gland (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of small intestine (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of stomach (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of testis (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of thyroid gland (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of urinary bladder (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of vagina (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of vulva (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of breast\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of colon\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of lung\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of oesophagus\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of ovary\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of pancreas",

Whereas the qualitative data contains in depth interview data collected from patient, physician and different stakeholders from private and public health system in rural part of India. The purpose of this dataset collected is to assess the burden of CRD and its social and economic impact on the community and health system.\n\nChronic Respiratory Diseases (CRD) especially asthma & Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) are common public health problems with high prevalence and mortality rates across the world. Although the majority of deaths and disability occur in developing countries, there is very little data on the true prevalence of asthma and COPD in these countries. Chronic respiratory symptoms are common in the general population but weak primary health care systems in resource-poor countries are often unable to diagnose the underlying disease condition. Factors contributing to low rates of diagnosis include limited access to, negative perceptions of, and lack of diagnostic capability in healthcare facilities. Determining the prevalence of asthma & COPD in the community has remained a challenge because of the poor sensitivity and specificity of the widely used questionnaire-based research tools, while spirometry, which is the gold standard diagnostic test, is a challenge to use in community-based epidemiological surveys. \n\nInformed by a scoping review of existing questionnaires and protocols used in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) to identify CRDs, we conducted a pilot survey to explore feasibility of using screening process in four countries (Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, and Pakistan). Our pilot findings will inform a future fully powered survey to determine the prevalence of asthma, COPD and other CRD in the community, using robust random sampling strategies, and quality assured spirometry undertaken by field workers.\n\nFor further information, see: https://www.ed.ac.uk/usher/respire/chronic-respiratory-disorders/estimating-chronic-respiratory-disease-burden",

This is entirely voluntary.\n\nAt each visit a field worker conducts a questionnaire, and supervises swab tests. A proportion of visits also include a blood sample being taken. The swab and blood samples are tested at laboratories.\n\nThe overall purpose of this study is to understand how many people across the UK have or may already have had the coronavirus. This will help the government manage the pandemic moving forwards.\n\nThe COVID-19 Community Infection Survey includes information on:\n\u2022\thow many people across England and Wales (extending to Scotland and Northern Ireland) test positive for COVID-19 at a given point in time, regardless of whether they report experiencing symptoms \n\u2022\tthe average number of new infections per week over the course of the study\n\u2022\tthe number of people who test positive for antibodies, to indicate how many people are ever likely to have had the virus\n\u2022\tkey demographic information (sex, age, occupation)",

A modelling exercise in collaboration with German scientists, will help to devise the prediction model, to predict pollen shedding and dispersal up to 3 days prior to the event. This is important to allow patients and other stakeholders to plan for an impending peak of pollen allergy and it\u2019s subsequent associated complications.\n\nThe outcome of this project will help to use the eDPSEEA model in other countries as well, as it is currently being used in Malaysia too. \n\nFor further information, see: https://www.ed.ac.uk/usher/respire/chronic-respiratory-disorders/seasonal-pollen-induced-asthma",

        "description": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0321-7       \n\nLung function is an important indicator of respiratory health and mortality. Measures of lung function show irreversible airway obstruction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a progressive condition affecting 900,000 people in the UK. Smoking is a strong risk factor for COPD but not all smokers are equally susceptible. Genetic approaches to understanding the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of good lungs aim to reveal previously unknown molecular targets for drug development and to facilitate stratified approaches to treatment and care. This project aims to detect rare genetic variants associated with lung function. Once discovered, such variants tend to exert a large effect on disease risk and provide a means to translate findings from genetic studies of lung function to clinical relevant research and development. The proposed study leverages the power of Uk Biobank and respiratory genomics to advance understanding of lung function and COPD.",

These measures are: 2015 English Index of Multiple Deprivation (composite and individual domains); 2016 Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (composite and individual domains); 2017 Northern Ireland Index of Multiple Deprivation (composite and individual domains); 2014 Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation (composite and individual domains)\nCarstairs Index: England, Wales and Scotland calculated using 2011 census data.\n\nAs standard, the most recent national Indices of Deprivation are provided for each country. It is important to note that the IMD indices are not comparable between countries in the UK. Older versions of the deprivation scores can be provided on request. The data are updated monthly. data are provided as quintiles or deciles of the deprivation score to prevent disclosure of patient location.

The CMO for Wales commissioned a collaboration of national bodies in Wales (NWIS, DU, NWSSP, PHW) to identify \u201chigh risk\u201d people for the Welsh population, based largely on the NHS Digital methodology. This list is referred to as the Shielded Patient List (SPL). \n\nThe \u201chigh risk\u201d list was defined as a subset of a wider group of people who may be \u201cat risk\u201d. Specific advice applies to these groups, currently this advice is:\n \u2022 \u201cAt Risk\u201d \u2013 large group normally at risk from the flu - should practice strict social distancing \n\u2022 \u201cAt high risk\u201d \u2013 a smaller sub-group (circa 70k), defined by CMO \u2013 should practice complete social \u201cshielding\u201d NHS Digital have described the methodology that has been used to identify patients who meet the high risk criteria due to their inclusion in one or more of the disease groups. \n\nAs there are differences in some of the systems used across the devolved nations, nuanced differences in application and interpretation of CMO guidance, this document describes the Welsh methodology.\n\nhttps://nwis.nhs.wales/coronavirus/coronavirus-content/coronavirus-documents/covid-19-high-risk-shielded-patient-list-identification-methodology/",

SAIL is currently expediting all requests that feed directly into the response to the COVID-19 national emergency, and therefore requests from NHS or Government institutions, or organisations working alongside such care providers and policymakers to feed intelligence directly back into the national response, are being expedited with a ~48-hour governance turnaround for such applications once made. Please make enquiries using the link at the bottom of the page which will go the SAIL Databank team, or to Chris Orton at c.orton@swansea.ac.uk\n\nSAIL is welcoming requests from other organisations and for longer-term academic study on the dataset, but please note if this is not directly relevant to the emergency research being carried out which directly interfaces with national responding agencies, there may be an access delay whilst priority use cases are serviced.",

PROMs are a means of collecting information on the effectiveness of care delivered to NHS patients as perceived by the patients themselves. The collection of this data will add to the set of information available on the care delivered to NHS-funded patients and will complement, and be used in conjunction with, existing information on the quality of services. Data was released for the first time as an experimental statistic in April 2010 at which time the extract service was also launched. \n\nThe PROMs dataset is made up of many data items relating to information collected through the Patient Reported Outcome Measures questionnaires completed by patients for a number of common elective procedures. Patients submit the questionnaires before and after their operation in order to establish their perceived levels of health and the impact the operation has had on their quality of life. The PROMs dataset includes responses to individual questions as well as overall totals for a number of different scoring systems for both pre-operative and post-operative questionnaires",

The data are collated nationally by the Register General before being passed to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), for use in statistics and coding. Coding includes such things cause of death coding using the International Classifications of Diseases (ICD) coding system, attributing socio-economic code classifications based on occupation. ONS maintains its own version of the data set for its use in statistics. The Civil Registration of Deaths data contains 14 million unique registrations since 1993 onwards, increasing yearly. Average 500,000 - 600,000 new death registrations yearly.

It intends to extend recruitment in all areas, and to other rare and common disease groups, with a target of ~300k by 2022. The NIHR BioResource acquires a self-reported health and lifestyle questionnaire from all participants at recruitment, save those recruited in rare disease clinics.  Typically variables include height, weight, smoking history and alcohol consumption, with addition of questions relating to disease history and current medications. This is used to pre-screen or match participants when inviting them to take part in experimental medicine studies.  De-identified versions of this data is available to researchers investigating the feasibility of future studies. Note: Valid metadata in DDI XML format was uploaded to the HDR UK metadata helpdesk.  While an entirely appropriate schema for capturing rich metadata, it could not be readily transformed to meet the Technical Metadata standards, which is (therefore) a poor approximation.",

After the patient is discharged the handwritten patient notes are transcribed by clinical coder into medical coding terminology (ICD10 and OPCS).\n\nThe data held in PEDW is of interest to public health services since it can provide information regarding both health service utilisation and also the incidence and prevalence of disease. However, since PEDW was created to track hospital activity from the point of view of payments for services, rather than epidemiological analysis, the use of PEDW for public health work is not straightforward. For example:\n\nCounts will vary depending on the number of diagnosis fields used e.g. primary only, all fields;\nThere are a number of different things that can be counted in PEDW e.g. individual episodes of care, admissions, discharges, periods of continuous care (group of episodes), patients or procedures.\nWhen looking at diagnosis or procedures the number will vary depending on whether you look at only in the primary diagnosis / procedure field or if the secondary fields are also included.\nCoding practices vary. In particular, coding practices for recording secondary diagnoses is likely to vary for different hospitals. This makes regional variations more difficult to interpret. The validation process led by the Corporate Health Improvement Programme and implemented by NWIS is aiming to address some of these inconsistencies.\n\nDue to the complexity and pitfalls of PEDW it is recommended that any PEDW requests for public health purposes are discussed with a member of the SAIL team. In turn the SAIL will seek advice from NWIS if required.",

        "description": "Many people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remain very breathless and limited. In some patients, with the appropriate pattern of emphysema, an operation called lung volume reduction surgery is effective at removing the worst affected area of lung. New techniques have been developed where emphysema can be treated using a fibre-optic camera called a bronchoscope. Trials have shown that using a bronchoscope to place endobronchial valves into the airways can be very effective in carefully selected patients and the technique is now being adopted in hospitals across the UK.\n\nThis study will collect data from people undergoing these procedures at hospitals across the UK to evaluate how well they work in practice and what factors at baseline influence response.\n\nBaseline, three month and 12 month follow up data will be collected. This will include lung function data, measures of exercise capacity, questionnaires about health status and CT scan results.\n\nQuestions addressed will include:\n\n(1) What lung function improvement is seen in clinical practice?\n\n(2) What factors determine who is most likely to respond?\n\n(3) How safe are the procedures and what is the rate of complications?\n\n(4) What proportion of people undergoing bronchoscopic procedures require repeat procedures or surgery subsequently?\n\n(5) Does long term survival differ between people undergoing the different treatments?\n\nThe study is supported by The British Lung Foundation and sponsored by Imperial College, London. By building collaboration, the establishment of the network will also produce a structure that will make evaluation of future bronchoscopic techniques easier bringing innovative treatments into play more quickly.",

        "description": "We aim to assess the feasibility of delivering a supported self-management incorporating an adapted pictorial asthma action plan for adult patients with asthma in clinical practice in a public primary care clinic in the Klang District, Selangor State, Malaysia. Dataset contains follow-up responses at one-, three- and six-months post intervention. \n\nSupported self-management has been shown to reduce asthma-related morbidity and mortality in high-income countries, but poor health literacy (especially in low- and middle-income countries) is a potential barrier to its effectiveness. This study aims to assess the feasibility of delivering supported self-management incorporating an adapted pictorial asthma action plan for adult patients with asthma attending a public primary care clinic in Malaysia. This study will proceed in two phases: 1) adaptation of the pictorial asthma action plan (AAP); and 2) a feasibility study including  feasibility of assessing costs. Following the adaptation of the AAP, we assess the feasibility of using the AAP to support self-management in adults with asthma. In a pre-post study, 70 patients aged 18 years and above with physician-diagnosed asthma and currently prescribed inhaled corticosteroids will be recruited. Our proposed primary outcome is asthma control (Global Initiative for Asthma symptom control). A pre-piloted questionnaire will be used to collect baseline data on socio-demography, healthcare utilisation and expenditure, health literacy, clinical parameters (body mass index; peak expiratory flow rate).  Follow-up will be at 1, 3, and 6 months. \n\nThe protocol was approved by the Medical Research Ethics Committee, Ministry of Health Malaysia and registered with National Medical Research Registry (NMRR-18-2683-43494). The study trial registration number is ISRCTN87128530 (Pre-results).",

        "description": "UNICORN leverages UK cohort studies with a focus on asthma and allergy more productively, and develops a sustainable, scalable scientific infrastructure to facilitate future work in this and other biomedical domains. It includes Study Team for Early Life Asthma Research (STELAR), which includes Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), Ashford and Isle of Wight cohorts (IoW), Manchester Asthma and Allergy Study (MAAS), Aberdeen Study of Eczema and Asthma To Observe the Effects of Nutrition (SEATON); Breathing Together; U-BIOPRED; and the Royal Brompton Severe Asthma cohort (paediatric) cohorts. When/where possible these data are to be linked to NHS data.\n\nAsthma and allergic diseases (food allergies, rhinitis, eczema) are the most common chronic diseases in childhood and adolescence. They usually start before school-age and are responsible for a heavy burden of ill health, including premature death. In response, we propose an innovative scientific research program which embraces a truly trans-disciplinary team science approach, and is of fundamental relevance both to biomedical research and to evidence-based health science more broadly. UNICORN builds directly on the substantive prior investments in both the science and infrastructure underpinning research in this domain. The project will assist UK to leverage its cohort studies with a focus on asthma and allergy more productively, and to develop a sustainable, scalable scientific infrastructure to facilitate future work in this and other biomedical domains.",

It can be caused by a variety of single gene defects, including conditions such as retinitis pigmentosa which often result in early onset blindness in childhood, whilst the risk of age related macular degeneration is caused by a variety of complex multigene defects causing visual loss in later life. Treatments are evolving for both diseases but the underlying pathogenesis and treatment of these diseases  remains elusive. We  have formed the biobank as a repository of fibroblasts (from skin and hair samples) from patients with a variety of retinal diseases that could then be used with induced pluripotent stem cell technology  to investigate causes and new treatments for these conditions.",

        "description": "For researchers   \nBlood collection\nWe collect blood from donors aged between 18-60, who have been screened to ensure that it is safe for them to donate, that they are in good health, and not taking medications that might interfere with experiments.\nDonors will have given consent for their samples to be used in a wide range of biomedical research applications, including genetic research and that undertaken by commercial organisations.\nWe are also able to collect samples from specific donors, for example within a certain age range, ethnicity or with a specific blood group. We can collect samples into a wide range of anticoagulant tubes, blood bags and other devices as required.\nProcessing\nWe use advanced technologies in our laboratory to test donated blood samples and to process them into the formats which are most useful to researchers. These include:\nWhole blood\n From a single tube of whole blood in a specific anticoagulant tube, up to a full bag of blood we can collect the exact volume of blood you need from donors best suited to your study and deliver it within precisely defined timeframes at the best temperature for your need.\nBuffy coat\n We routinely process whole blood units into buffy coat preparations which are used as a source of PBMCs by our clients. We can also process smaller volumes of blood from blood collection tubes into buffy coat.\nPlasma\n We can either collect a specific volume of blood in the anticoagulant of your choice and prepare plasma, or you can source plasma samples that we have banked from a wide selection of donors for screening purposes.\nSerum\n We can either collect a specific volume of blood and prepare serum to suit your needs, or you can select from serum samples that we have previously banked from a wide selection of donors.\nPBMCs\n We are preparing PBMCs from whole units of blood within a very short timeframe from venepuncture (typically processing begins within 1 hour). PBMCs are produced using a density centrifugation, characterized and frozen in a proprietary freezing solution designed to maximise cell viability.\nCustom services\n We can develop specific processes to suit your exact requirements, so please get in contact if there is something specific you need for your research",

IMCI classifications depend on the clinical assessment skills of service providers and this subjectivity might lead to misclassification and inappropriate referral/treatment.\n\nHypoxemia (low levels of oxygen in the blood) is one of the strongest predictors of pneumonia mortality. Hypoxemia can be measured simply and effectively using pulse oximetry (PO).\n\nThe latest IMCI guidelines, from the World Health Organization (WHO), include the use of PO to classify severity of pneumonia in children and manage accordingly. Current IMCI practices in Pune district do not include PO in the treatment algorithms.\n\nThe aim of the project is to assess the feasibility of introducing PO in the IMCI programme in Pune and explore barriers to and facilitators of effective implementation with assessment of the readiness of the public health system.\n\nFor further information, see: https://www.ed.ac.uk/usher/respire/acute-respiratory-disorders/pulse-oximetry-india\"",

The aims of this study are to identify genetic, serum and other biomarkers that may identify specific molecular mechanisms, reflecting disease endotypes that are shared among patients with progressive pulmonary fibrosis regardless of aetiology. Furthermore, it is anticipated that these biomarkers will help predict fibrotic activity that may identify patterns of disease behaviour with greater accuracy than current clinical phenotyping.\n\n200 participants with the multidisciplinary team confirmed fibrotic lung disease (50 each of rheumatoid-interstitial lung disease (ILD), asbestosis, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis and unclassifiable ILD) and 50 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis participants, recruited as positive controls, will be followed up for 2 years. Participants will have blood samples, lung function tests, quality of life questionnaires and a subgroup will be offered bronchoscopy. Participants will also be given the option of undertaking blinded home handheld spirometry for the first 3 months of the study. The primary end point will be identification of a biomarker that predicts disease progression, defined as 10% relative change in forced vital capacity (FVC) or death at 12 months.",

The research programme uses the unique population structures in our Scottish and Croatian cohorts to deliver biological understanding of the causes of variation in complex traits. Together, the ORCADES and VIKING biobanks contain 4,000 samples from volunteers with ancestry from the Northern Isles of Scotland, www.ed.ac.uk/viking. Collectively, the CROATIA cohorts contain 6,000 participants. All of these biobanks were constructed from people with high kinship and extensive pedigree structures. They were collected together with detailed phenotype data, some of which is longitudinal. Plasma, serum, urine and DNA samples, as well as detailed genomic, proteomic and metabolomics data can be made available for collaborative research.",

        "description": "The Welsh Health Survey informs local government, NHS, and nationwide health strategy.\n\nThe Welsh Health Survey (WHS) collects information on the health and health-related lifestyles of people living in Wales. It is a major source of information about the health of people in Wales, the way the NHS is used, and behaviours that can affect health, such as smoking and alcohol consumption.\n\nData for the WHS is collected via face-to-face-interviews and self-completion questionnaires. The sampling unit for the WHS are households, however all adults within households were asked to take part. Families with children under the age of 16 are eligible, however where the household has 3 or more children, up to two children between the ages of 0 and 15 are randomly selected for inclusion in the study. Interviews are used to collect data at the household level, with questionnaires distributed to household members. Information on the household type and employment status of the household reference person are collected, and the interviewer is asked to comment on the condition of the property. Separate self-completion questionnaires are used to collect data for adults and young people (aged 13-15), whilst adults/guardians are required to complete questionnaires on behalf of children younger than 13 years old.\n\nThe WHS data, as provided via the UK Data Archive, is split into two separate datasets, these relating to adults \u2013 16 and older \u2013 and children. The WHS can be analysed at both the individual and household level, with appropriate weights being supplied for each. The dataset provides a household identifier which allows for adult-child records to be combined for research exploring \u2018household\u2019 health or the links between parental and child health, for example.",

It intends to extend recruitment in all areas, and to other rare and common disease groups, with a target of ~300k by 2022. The NIHR BioResource acquires a case report form at recruitment for each participant recruited on the basis of their disease.  Typically variables include questions that may be used to partition or group patients by their disease course and severity, and include disease history and medication use. This is used to pre-screen or match participants when inviting them to take part in experimental medicine studies.  De-identified versions of this data is available to researchers investigating the feasibility of future studies.Note: Valid metadata in DDI XML format was uploaded to the HDR UK metadata helpdesk.

These measures are: 2015 English Index of Multiple Deprivation (composite and individual domains); 2016 Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (composite and individual domains); 2017 Northern Ireland Index of Multiple Deprivation (composite and individual domains); 2014 Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation (composite and individual domains)\nCarstairs Index: England, Wales and Scotland calculated using 2011 census data.\n\nAs standard, the most recent national Indices of Deprivation are provided for each country. It is important to note that the IMD indices are not comparable between countries in the UK. Older versions of the deprivation scores can be provided on request. The data are updated monthly. Data are provided as quintiles or deciles of the deprivation score to prevent disclosure of patient location. In order to prevent the possibility of deductive disclosure of the location of a practice, researchers will only be provided with one of the above linked datasets for any one study.",

These are all functions that NHS Digital have been asked to deliver as a national resource in response to COVID-19, through the recent direction from the SoS.\n\nAntigen test results relating to subjects tested within the following:\n\n\u2022 Drive through test centre\n\u2022 Home test\n\nThe Key Worker Testing results relate to a subject who has been tested. This may be a key worker or a symptomatic household member. \n\nThe dataset will be composed of:\n\u2022 Patient identity and contact details\n\u2022 Testing centre and laboratory details\n\u2022 Test results\n\u2022 Test kit types (manufacturer)\n\u2022 Key worker indicator and employer organisation\n\nThe data cover UK and is collected under SofS Covid Direction under s254 of the HSCA 2012 and s255 requests from devolved administrations for Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.\n\nOriginal scope was Key workers but this has now been expanded to include all pillar 2 antigen testing, which is Commercial Antigen testing for citizens.\n\nCovers npex.npex, npex.randox, Legacy, deloitte and BSA flows.\nCovers England, NI, Scotland and Wales. [Originally it was just some Welsh patient data if they were tested in England, Scotland, NI etc, but scope has changed]",

        "description": "Background:\nThe Leeds NIHR Biomarker Research Tissue Bank (RTB) is part of a National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Programme Grants for Applied Research award, focused on biomarker evaluation in selected disease areas.  The RTB was established for the multicentre collection and storage of samples from patients with liver diseases recruited within a randomised controlled trial (ELUCIDATE) of a biomarker panel, renal cancer patients and patients undergoing kidney transplant.\nThe Leeds NIHR Biomarker RTB is jointly managed along with the Multidisciplinary RTB by the Joint RTB Management Committee. The Leeds NIHR Research Tissue Bank (RTB) was given favourable ethical opinion by the Leeds (East) Research Ethics Committee on 15th June 2010 (Current REC ref: 15/YH/0099).  \n\nSample collections:\nOver the duration of the programme, 2,116 participants were recruited in total with 5,976 samples. Sample collection has taken place in multiple centres in the UK. These comprise:\n-\t847 patients with liver disease each with a single serum samples \n-\t514 patients on the kidney transplant waiting list including 312 subsequently transplanted, with 3,806 samples, each sample including multiple aliquots of serum, plasma and urine\n-\t706 patients with suspected renal cancer (200 longitudinal and 506 cross-sectional)  with 1,132 samples, including multiple aliquots of serum, plasma, buffy coat and urine and an FFPE tissue block (frozen available in Leeds patients only)\n-\t149 healthy volunteers with 191 samples, each sample including multiple aliquots of serum, plasma and urine.\nAll samples were collected according to SOPs and have been shipped from the participating sites and stored centrally in Leeds Biobanking and Sample Processing Facility.  Associated clinical data has been collected using standard study-specific case report forms (CRFs), including long-term follow-up in many cases. \nInitially access to samples is prioritised for the needs of the Programme and investigators involved but additional collaborative access will then be possible. To find out further information please e-mail our Research Tissue Bank and Sample Processing Facility Manager, Pirkko-Liisa Muhonen at rtb@leeds.ac.uk.",

The majority (c. 75%) of our studies are local CI led, and we specialise mainly in diabetes, obesity and related pathologies. However, the majority of people within the EXTEND study are fit and well.\nThe RDETB has overarching ethics to collect samples from diagnostic procedures with patients' consent. Each collection within the RDETB uses a standardised consent and collection approach to obtain material that would otherwise be destroyed or not retained. There is scope for prospective studies recruiting through the RDETB.\nBoth collections have a steering committee controlling access, including lay members from within the biobank. There is a standardised approach for requests and the committee sits once a month. In addition, access to gifted samples within the PRB will involve contact with the PI, where possible. Some studies have additional steering committees where they have been carried out in consortia with other centres.\nFirst contact via this directory is encouraged, to establish your needs and our ability to meet them.",

Dataset contains follow-up responses at one-, three- and six-months post intervention. \n\nSupported self-management has been shown to reduce asthma-related morbidity and mortality in high-income countries, but poor health literacy (especially in low- and middle-income countries) is a potential barrier to its effectiveness. This study aims to assess the feasibility of delivering supported self-management incorporating an adapted pictorial asthma action plan for adult patients with asthma attending a public primary care clinic in Malaysia. This study will proceed in two phases: 1) adaptation of the pictorial asthma action plan (AAP); and 2) a feasibility study including  feasibility of assessing costs. Following the adaptation of the AAP, we assess the feasibility of using the AAP to support self-management in adults with asthma. In a pre-post study, 70 patients aged 18 years and above with physician-diagnosed asthma and currently prescribed inhaled corticosteroids will be recruited. Our proposed primary outcome is asthma control (Global Initiative for Asthma symptom control). A pre-piloted questionnaire will be used to collect baseline data on socio-demography, healthcare utilisation and expenditure, health literacy, clinical parameters (body mass index; peak expiratory flow rate).  Follow-up will be at 1, 3, and 6 months. \n\nThe protocol was approved by the Medical Research Ethics Committee, Ministry of Health Malaysia and registered with National Medical Research Registry (NMRR-18-2683-43494). The study trial registration number is ISRCTN87128530 (Pre-results).",

It intends to extend recruitment in all areas, and to other rare and common disease groups, with a target of ~300k by 2022. The NIHR BioResource extracts DNA from blood- and saliva- samples taken at recruitment, and measures a panel of SNPs on each DNA sample, using a commodity SNP genotyping array from e.g. Illumina or Affymetrix (now Thermofisher). This is used to pre-screen or match participants when inviting them to take part in experimental medicine studies.  De-identified versions of this data is available to researchers investigating the feasibility of future studies. The Technical Metadata describes a SNP annotation file \u2013 i.e. what the chip is measuring.  The file itself has as many rows as there are SNPs represented on the chip, and is proprietary to the manufacturer, although deeply familiar to researchers.",

Neonatal units submit data through their Electronic Patient Record system supplier. At present, there is information on around one million babies and 10 million days of care in the NNRD.\n\nThe NNRD is available to support audit, evaluations, bench-marking, quality improvement and clinical, epidemiological, health services and policy research to improve patient care and outcomes. Data in the NNRD comprise the Neonatal Data Set (ISB1595), an approved NHS Information Standard and include demographic details, daily records of interventions and treatments throughout the neonatal inpatient stay, information on diagnoses and outcomes, and follow-up health status at age two years. \n\nThe Neonatal Data Analysis Unit was founded to support the management and development of the National Neonatal Research Database (NNRD) established in 2007 by Professor Modi, and related research.\n\nMore information can be found at\nhttps://www.imperial.ac.uk/neonatal-data-analysis-unit",

These can arise from problems with the mother's health, her lifestyle, her physical environment, medication, the placenta not working properly, complications during birth, or as consequence of being born too early. Adversity in these periods of developmental vulnerability can have persistent effects on the long-term health of the child, including physical and mental health disorders. We also know that if a mother has complications in pregnancy, that she herself may suffer from increased risk of ill-heath in later life, for example cardiovascular disease, diabetes or mental health problems. \n\neLIXIR is a prospective collection of blood samples from routine antenatal and neonatal appointments and is due to begin collecting in 2018.",

Even where places are equipped with facilities, the availability of trained health care providers is a challenge.\n\nRecent advances in technology have enabled clinicians to deploy telemedicine in remote locations. Telehealthcare provides a holistic approach to health and wellbeing by improving access. However, multiple barriers still exist to implement telehealthcare and to scale-up the available technology.\n\nUse of telehealthcare for the management of Chronic Respiratory Disorders (CRDs) in India is not yet proven, hence a feasibility study will help to explore barriers and facilitators to the successful implementation of teleconsultation. This could be done by documenting views, opinions and experiences of opinion leaders and by understanding the perception of the stakeholders, including providers and patients, towards doctor-to-doctor teleconsultation.\n\nThis study will generate evidence for creating a policy on \u2018Management of overall chronic diseases at remote rural area in India using teleconsultation\u2019.\n\nFor further information, see: https://www.ed.ac.uk/usher/respire/phd-studentships/rutuja-patil",
