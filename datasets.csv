This is submitted to NHS Digital for processing and is returned to healthcare providers as the Secondary Uses Service (SUS) data set and includes information relating to payment for activity undertaken. It allows hospitals to be paid for the care they deliver. 
This same data can also be processed and used for non-clinical purposes, such as research and planning health services. Because these uses are not to do with direct patient care, they are called 'secondary uses'. This is the SUS data set.
SUS data covers all NHS Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) in England, including:
•	private patients treated in NHS hospitals
•	patients resident outside of England
•	care delivered by treatment centres (including those in the independent sector) funded by the NHS
Each SUS record contains a wide range of information about an individual patient admitted to an NHS hospital, including:
•	clinical information about diagnoses and operations
•	patient information, such as age group, gender and ethnicity
•	administrative information, such as dates and methods of admission and discharge
•	geographical information such as where patients are treated and the area where they live
NHS Digital apply a strict statistical disclosure control in accordance with the NHS Digital protocol, to all published SUS data. This suppresses small numbers to stop people identifying themselves and others, to ensure that patient confidentiality is maintained.

Who SUS is for
SUS provides data for the purpose of healthcare analysis to the NHS, government and others including:

The Secondary Users Service (SUS) database is made up of many data items relating to A&E care
delivered by NHS hospitals in England. Many of these items form part of the national Commissioning Data
Set (CDS), and are generated by the patient administration systems within each hospital.
•	national bodies and regulators, such as the Department of Health, NHS England, Public Health England, NHS Improvement and the CQC
•	local Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs)
•	provider organisations
•	government departments
•	researchers and commercial healthcare bodies
•	National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE)
•	patients, service users and carers
•	the media

Uses of the statistics
The statistics are known to be used for:
•	national policy making
•	benchmarking performance against other hospital providers or CCGs  
•	academic research
•	analysing service usage and planning change
•	providing advice to ministers and answering a wide range of parliamentary questions
•	national and local press articles
•	international comparison

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by the build-up of scar tissue in the lungs. It is believed that the damage to the alveolar epithelium is followed by an aberrant wound healing response leading to the deposition of dense fibrotic tissue, reducing the lungs’ flexibility and inhibiting gas transfer. IPF still has limited therapeutic interventions and a high mortality rate within 3-5 years from diagnosis. To date, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of IPF susceptibility have associated common variants (minor allele frequency [MAF]>5%) near genes involved in host defence, telomere maintenance, cell-cell adhesion and signalling in disease susceptibility. 
Meta-analysis of GWAS of IPF susceptibility. Building up on published GWAS results (PMID: 24429156, 23583980, 29066090) and novel study samples, we have performed the largest GWAS of IPF susceptibility to date to identify novel genes and further advance in the understanding of IPF pathogenesis and risk (bioRxiv https://doi.org/10.1101/636761 and PMID:31710517). The discovery stage of the study comprised up to 2,668 IPF cases and 8,591 controls from 3 studies (Chicago study: 541 IPF cases and 542 controls, Colorado study: 1515 fibrotic Idiopathic Interstitial pneumonia cases and 4683 controls, UK Study: 612 IPF cases and 3366 controls)  and replication was pursued in an additional 1,456 IPF cases and 11,874 controls.

Genetics can strongly influence this response, as well as the initial propensity to obesity. Several genes have been implicated but more in-depth mechanistic studies are needed to understand how genes affect energy regulation and mediate the beneficial effects of bariatric surgery.
The Obesity Research Biobank Syndicate (ORBiS) aims to fulfil this need. It provides a comprehensive collection of high-quality biological samples and patient data to facilitate mechanistic research and help translate it to improved treatments for patients. 
Patients undergoing bariatric surgery are recruited from multiple centres in the UK. With informed consent, blood or saliva samples are collected pre-operatively and tissue collected during surgery. Samples include: adipose tissue (subcutaneous and visceral), muscle, liver, stomach and small intestine. Relevant clinical and demographic data are linked and stored pseudo anonymised in a secure database. Tissue collections are transported to and processed in the ORBiS laboratory at University College London, and stored at UCL-Royal Free Hospital Biobank for future use.

Lung function is an important indicator of respiratory health and mortality. Measures of lung function show irreversible airway obstruction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a progressive condition affecting 900,000 people in the UK. Smoking is a strong risk factor for COPD but not all smokers are equally susceptible. Genetic approaches to understanding the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of good lungs aim to reveal previously unknown molecular targets for drug development and to facilitate stratified approaches to treatment and care. This project aims to detect rare genetic variants associated with lung function.

The HBRC resides within the purpose-built Advanced Therapies Facility (ATF) within the College of Medical and Dental Sciences (CMDS) at the University of Birmingham (UoB). The ATF also houses both cell and gene therapy manufacturing units.
Samples are collected, processed and stored (or released) from patients in a variety of disease settings in response to local demand and research strategies in order to facilitate existing research and enable future research areas to be developed. Samples may comprise adult or paediatric tissue which is waste, or surplus to diagnosis taken at the time of surgery or treatment, additional samples taken specifically for research purposes, material taken from patients enrolled in clinical trials, and control material. The HBRC works with local researchers and carries out bespoke tissue collections. All samples can be annotated with the appropriate clinical data which makes them scientifically useful. 
Although the HBRC is primarily a resource for local researchers within CMDS and local NHS Trusts, applications from other UK research groups and the commercial sector are also considered.

In addition, the most recent study – “IMPORT” (Improving Population Outcomes for Renal Tumours of childhood) contains data on the presenting symptoms that led to diagnosis of kidney cancer,

Childhood renal tumour dataset

This document describes the research dataset constructed through the Improving Population Outcomes for Renal Tumours of childhood (IMPORT) study from 2012 – 2019 (https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/find-a-clinical-trial/study-improving-treatment-children-kidney-cancer. The aim of this prospective clinical observational study is to achieve continuous improvement in short and long term outcomes for children with Wilms tumour and other rarer types of childhood renal tumours. The study collects clinical, molecular and imaging data to underpin the introduction of a more personalised approach to risk stratification – the process by which each child is assigned to one of several ‘standard of care’ treatment arms according to the predicted risk of their tumour recurring. 

It is a live database, currently comprising data on 670 children with kidney tumours who are resident across the UK and Republic of Ireland. This represents >90% of all incident cases diagnosed in the population. Clinical data and patient samples are collected with explicit consent of their parent/guardian for use in research and for sharing with the relevant national cancer registration service according to where the child is resident at diagnosis.

Data are collected throughout the patient journey and are presented in tables with each data item as a comma separated value (CSV) corresponding to a data field captured through a case report form (CRF). These span the following timepoints from presentation to completion of treatment and then annual follow up or reporting of any events (relapse/death/second tumour). 

F1 Registration information
F2 Pre-operative chemotherapy (Unilateral tumours only)
F3 Surgical form – operative findings
F4 Pathology form – institutional pathologist
F6 Post-operative chemotherapy
F11 Cardiotoxicity reporting form
F12 Bilateral Wilms tumour form – additional registration information (12a) and response assessment (12b)
F15 Reference Pathology – “Central review”
F17 Treatment of relapse or progression
F18 Follow up form – for annual follow up reporting and to report any relapse or death.
F20A End of treatment summary (Unilateral tumours)
F20B End of treatment summary (Bilateral tumours)

Details of the content of each CRF are in the table below.

Most children (~90%) with Wilms tumour survive their cancer. Hence, an important aspect of the dataset is the planned linkage of each child’s data to their national cancer registration record. This will permit measurement of very long term health outcomes in adulthood by linkage to routine health care data utilising the approved information governance systems through which the UK’s national cancer registration services work with the NHS to ensure patient confidentiality. 

The IMPORT study is one of five sequential clinical trials and studies that registered the majority of children diagnosed with kidney cancer in the UK and Republic of Ireland between 1980-2019 (over 3,000 patients). It is intended that these additional four closed trial datasets will be made available in the same way during 2020.

These trials’ primary endpoints, of relapse-free and overall survival according to clinically defined risk groups, have been published, with full clinical quality assurance completed. Over that 39 year period, risk stratification and treatment schedules have been refined many times, to reduce exposure to therapies that may cause long term side effects such as heart damage or second tumours. These adverse ‘late effects’ may take decades before they are first seen. Hence, these linked datasets are an important proof of principle about how very long term outcomes can be studied through linkage of clinical trials to routine health care data sources.  

The IMPORT dataset will continue to be enlarged and enriched with tumour molecular information (copy number, genomic sequencing) and imaging review data (CT/MRI scans). These data items are not available for the previous closed trials.

Plans for the linked dataset with the national cancer registration and analysis service (NCRAS) of Public Health England. 

This project will create a new permanent data linkage between each patient’s trial identifier and data and their existing national cancer registration record, with all personally identifiable data being handled within the existing nationally approved information governance and data protection frameworks of the clinical trial units and the cancer registration service of each nation. The following technical description applies to Public Health England’s National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS). Access to the linked community prescription data is made available through PHE’s Office for Data Release.

NCRAS routinely collects and quality assures clinical information on all cases of cancer that occur in people living in England to construct a cancer registration record.  The data collected by NCRAS comes from several sources including Multi-Disciplinary Team meetings and pathology reports. The patient identifiers collected facilitate linkage to other routinely collected datasets, that include Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) with details of all admissions, A&E attendances and outpatient appointments at NHS hospitals in England, mortality data, the Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy and Radiotherapy datasets from all hospital providers and community dispensed prescriptions data. 

Patient-level linkage to inpatient HES is routinely processed by NCRAS. PHE receives pseudonymised dispensed prescriptions data from NHS Business Services Authority, allowing patient-level linkage to the National Cancer Registration Dataset without revealing the identities of those without cancer.  Prescription data is available from April 2015 to February 2019, providing a 3-4 year window of prescription drug usage by survivors of childhood renal tumours. 

The project’s primary aim is addressed by calculating cumulative and relative risks of hospitalisation for specific organ dysfunctions from the HES-linked data set and relative risks of prescriptions for specific drugs compared to the general population rates. This newly created linked dataset can be refreshed for future follow up studies and linkage to additional datasets that may become available such as patient-reported outcome measures.

For HES-based analyses, follow-up will start at whichever is the later of 1 April 1997 and date of renal tumour diagnosis.  For community prescriptions analyses, follow-up will start at whichever is the later of 1 April 2015 and date of renal tumour diagnosis.  For both sets of analyses, follow-up will end at whichever is earliest of death, emigration, latest date for which linked death certificate data are complete, and the latest date for which data are complete in the linked databases for HES or community prescriptions as applicable.

Cumulative risk of hospitalisation for specific organ dysfunctions will be estimated from the HES-linked data set with death treated as a competing risk.  Relative risk of hospitalisation for specific organ dysfunctions will be estimated by dividing the observed number in the HES-linked data set by the expected number obtained by multiplying the number of person-years accumulated in each age-sex-calendar year stratum in the study cohort by the general population rate in the corresponding stratum calculated from the entire HES database.  Relative risks of prescriptions for specific drugs will be estimated in a similar way using the linked community prescription data set and the entire community prescription database.",GB,en,13,DATA-CAN,1 GB,"GOSH is the custodian of the latest study dataset - IMPORT.

In some patients, with the appropriate pattern of emphysema, an operation called lung volume reduction surgery is effective at removing the worst affected area of lung. New techniques have been developed where emphysema can be treated using a fibre-optic camera called a bronchoscope. Trials have shown that using a bronchoscope to place endobronchial valves into the airways can be very effective in carefully selected patients and the technique is now being adopted in hospitals across the UK.

This study will collect data from people undergoing these procedures at hospitals across the UK to evaluate how well they work in practice and what factors at baseline influence response.

Baseline, three month and 12 month follow up data will be collected. This will include lung function data, measures of exercise capacity, questionnaires about health status and CT scan results.

Questions addressed will include:

(1) What lung function improvement is seen in clinical practice?

(2) What factors determine who is most likely to respond?

(3) How safe are the procedures and what is the rate of complications?

(4) What proportion of people undergoing bronchoscopic procedures require repeat procedures or surgery subsequently?

(5) Does long term survival differ between people undergoing the different treatments?

The study is supported by The British Lung Foundation and sponsored by Imperial College, London.

All participants provided a serum sample at recruitment with 50,262 providing further longitudinal annual samples (median of 9 samples). Women were free of any active malignancy at enrolment (2001-2005). During the follow-up period of >15 years to-date a proportion of those have subsequently developed a number of different diseases.

National primary care sentinel network:
The RCGP RSC is nationally representative a network of over 500 general practices (GP) providing pseudonymised data for weekly surveillance of infectious diseases; our data are also available for quality improvement, research and education.  Research based on the RCGP RSC data have been published in the best journals including BMJ, Lancet and Diabetes Care.
Observational research
The disease surveillance program is commissioned by Public Health England (PHE) and covers 37 infectious diseases including influenza. The RCGP RSC is a nationally representative population.  The RCGP RSC and PHE, and its predecessor organizations have an over 50-year history of collaboration in influenza and respiratory disease surveillance and vaccine effectiveness studies.  Each practice in the network is reported on by all 37 infectious disease on a weekly basis and are graphically compared with the network as a whole (on their own web based dashboard); this drives both quality improvement in clinical care and also raises data quality, with our practice liaison team providing timely support to practices requiring help with any disparities in their information.  Thus, the observational researcher benefits from a data warehouse of patient level records going back decades with consistently coded data, able to support both longitudinal and cross-sectional study designs.
Interventional research – ambition to be a hub for trials 
The RCGP RSC has produced a ‘Weekly Return’ of infections and respiratory disease since 1967, though over time it has expanded in terms of size, scope, sample collection and its capability with linking with other datasets. The databases systems at the RCGP RSC can process large numbers of patients’ data rapidly. The typical duration for generating the weekly report is under 4 hours. The weekly report reached its highest denominator of 3 million patients in last week of October 2019.
The RCGP RSC hosts Workload Observatory (funded by NHS England) for GPs to understand trends of patients with multiple and more complex conditions. Using disease specific dashboards, general practices are provided weekly updated data quality indicators and comparison with other practices in the RCGP RSC network. This process allows practices to continuously improve their data quality and increase the quality of the RCGP RSC studies over time.
We regularly administer questionnaires in our studies and are experienced in collecting samples from our network of practices.  Practice level support from our dedicated practice liaison team is enhanced by our suite of dashboard technologies delivering rapid feedback to each of our practices. Hence combing our expertise in real world data analysis, high frequency of practice support and our continual development of internet-based practice level interaction, we are well placed for providing a low cost pragmatic trials platform for quality improvement studies or as a medicinal trials platform. 

Clinical concepts are ontologically defined for clinical concepts as part of developing a study protocol.  We have clinical and programming expertise to assist researchers in developing new ontologies for case finding and have a pool of existing ontologies and associated computer algorithms for extracting the data.

We don’t aim to charge more than the costs of running the study.
The scale and complexity of a study are two of the key determinants driving the cost of a study.  However, we aim to leverage on our previously acquired domain knowledge and experience, including existing ontologies, code lists, data extraction methods and statistical analyses.
Observational studies:
Data only – cost of the extract, training (if needed) to access our secure network statistical disclosure control prior to data release
Other requirements – questionnaires, samples, interviews
Interventional studies:
In addition to costs indicated as part of observational studies, interventional study costs will be higher, accounting for ongoing monitoring of the intervention with participating RCGP RSC network practices.
National observatory – provision:
The development of automated reports, in data formats such as XML and/or web-based dashboards, requires additional development and ongoing maintenance and will require additional funding.
Benefits to member practices:
We generally add a proportionate charge to provide benefits to member practices (and ultimately their patients).  This may often take the form of a dashboard and quality improvement activity, domain related but under the editorial control of RCGP RSC. 
Costing process 
Applicants will be responsible for any costs associated with data extraction and other aspects of collaboration. Costs are kept to a minimum. However, a RCGP RSC Practice Development Fund contribution in included to develop benefits and data quality in member practices.  Broadly 10% of the value of contracts is reinvested into member practices, in addition to any payments for research work undertaken. 
Any potential costs will be discussed at the monthly RCGP RSC Operational meeting, held each month, and researchers will be contacted as soon after the meeting as possible. Data extraction can start once these costs have been through a University approval process and formal agreements are in place.
For studies requiring active participation of General Practices, a contribution to cover practice staff members’ time and expenses will be expected.  This is set broadly in line with National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) levels of charges for practice time.

Each centre includes several NHS Trusts and hospitals. GMCs recruit and consent patients. They then provide DNA samples and clinical information for analysis.

Illumina, a biotechnology company, have been commissioned to sequence the DNA of participants. They return the whole genome sequences to Genomics England. We have created a secure, monitored, infrastructure to store the genome sequences and clinical data. The data is analysed within this infrastructure and any important findings, like a diagnosis, are passed back to the patient’s doctor.

To help make sure that the project brings benefits for people who take part, we have created the Genomics England Clinical Interpretation Partnership (GeCIP). GeCIP brings together funders, researchers, NHS teams and trainees. They will analyse the data – to help ensure benefits for patients and an increased understanding of genomics. The data will also be used for medical and scientific research. This could be research into diagnosing, understanding or treating disease.

The Leeds Biobanking and Sample Processing Lab (LBSPL) is based at St James's University Hospital and is an important element in the Leeds Clinical Research Facility (LCRF). LBSPL is dedicated to providing a sample processing service for clinical trials, and for many biobanking activities within the University and Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust.  These currently include collections of tissue, and fluid samples such as blood and urine obtained from consented patients diagnosed with kidney, bladder, colorectal and ovarian cancer, brain tumours, and patients undergoing renal transplant. These are processed and stored in research tissue banks (Leeds Multidisciplinary RTB and Leeds NIHR Biomarker RTB) and used as a valuable resource for wider research activities.
The Leeds Multidisciplinary Research Tissue Bank (RTB) was given favourable ethical opinion by the Leeds (East) Research Ethics Committee on 3rd March 2010 and renewed 5 years later (Current REC ref: 15/YH/0080).  

Current situation:
The LBSPL provides ongoing sample processing support to a variety of local or commercial clinical trials requiring samples to be collected for PK/PD endpoints or other associated translational studies. The Leeds Multidisciplinary RTB currently holds matched normal and malignant frozen renal tissue samples from ~600 patients with renal cancer, and plasma, serum, buffy coat and urine samples from ~800 renal cancer patients either prior to surgery/treatment or during treatment, for example with sunitinib. In addition, fluid samples have been collected from patients with benign urological conditions, healthy controls, patients prior to and following renal transplant A population-based TMA including tissue from ~300 RCC patients has also been established. From having solely a renal focus, the RTB has expanded to now also include frozen normal tissue samples, and frozen tissue and urine samples from >1,000 patients with bladder cancer, frozen tissue from patients with brain tumours and limited samples from patients with ovarian cancer or colorectal cancer (no new collections ongoing in these areas). The Leeds NIHR BioRTB has closed to recruitment and contains a bank of fluid samples from patients with liver disease, renal cancer and patient undergoing renal transplantation. These were collected as part of a multicentre initiative in the UK, together with associated clinical data, and are intended for use in biomarker validation studies.  

Sample processing and clinical data:
Samples are processed according to the relevant quality controlled Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) within Good Clinical Practice (GCLP) laboratories. The dedicated sample processing team of laboratory technicians, administrative staff and a Quality Assurance manager works together to ensure that all samples are handled, processed, stored and tracked to the highest standards. The samples are stored accordingly at the correct temperature (e.g. snap frozen tissue in liquid nitrogen, plasma, serum and buffy coats at -80oC). All freezers and liquid nitrogen dewars which hold patient samples are monitored using the Tutela system, a 24/7 web-based alert response temperature monitoring system.
Full clinical data is being collected using CRFs. Follow-up data and data available later such as pathology results are obtained from the relevant hospital records/databases by trained personnel with appropriate access. We hope to move to more automated data linkage in the future through working with the Leeds Institute of Data Analytics.

CARIS collects information about any fetus or baby who has or is suspected of having a congenital anomaly and whose mother is normally resident in Wales at time of birth. It includes babies in whom anomalies are diagnosed at any time from conception to the end of the first year of life. Data collection commenced on 1st January 1998 and includes any baby where pregnancy ended after this date.

CARIS uses a multi-source data collection method using a wide range of sources within the NHS. This ranges from antenatal ultrasound, clinical letters, post-mortems and laboratory results. CARIS also accesses a number of databases including SHIRE (Medical Genetics database), PEDW, NCCHD, Paediatric Cardiology database. Medical records are accessed to confirm, validate and add further details to the information already collected.

The database contains detailed information on clinical prognostic factors including detailed treatment and stage information. A unique quality of the Yorkshire Register is that it has pre-linked data with hospital admissions datasets including inpatient, outpatient, A&E, Mental Health HES which has been used to explore long-term morbidity in the cohort. Primary care linked data have been requested and are pending. Linked educational attainment and unemployment/social benefits data are currently being sought (ethical approval in place). Demand is largely underpinned by ongoing epidemiological and cancer
outcomes requests from University postgraduate researchers, PGT students, and other children’s tumour registers. However, pharma has also requested some of the registry data. Ethics and Research Governance are all current, the former approved as a Research Database by the Northern & Yorkshire MREC (Ref MREC 0/3/1) from which data can be requested by external researchers, and approval from the Health Research Authority Confidentiality Advisory Group to process identifiable patient data without consent (Ref—CAG 1-07(b)/2014). The Register goes beyond the dataset held by NCRAS in having much more rich and detailed treatment histories of every patient through active follow-up so beyond the traditional 6-month window since diagnosis used by NCRAS, as well as more complete tumour staging information. Register also records any cancer recurrence alongside any subsequent treatment received. 

The Yorkshire Specialist Register of Cancer in Children and Young People exists primarily to underpin epidemiological research examining the patterns and causes of cancer in children and young people and to facilitate health services research describing the patient experience in the context of care received by health professionals. The YSRCCYP is an established information resource for local clinicians and commissioners, and forms the basis for national and international collaborative research.
The core aims of the YSRCCYP are to:
•	Maintain the accurate and complete collection of clinical and socio-demographic data on children, teenagers and young adults with cancer in Yorkshire, specifically information not otherwise available from other routine NHS sources.
•	Investigate the effectiveness of healthcare delivery for children and young people, specifically the impact on survival and long-term health.
•	Undertake epidemiological research, comprising incidence and survival analyses.
•	Describe environmental risk factors for childhood and young adult cancer.

Example of three recent research studies by the Yorkshire Register research team are as follows:

1. Respiratory morbidity in young people surviving cancer: Population based study of hospital admissions, treatment related risk factors and subsequent mortality
(Smith et al, 2019)

Respiratory diseases are a major cause of late morbidity and mortality amongst childhood cancer survivors. This population-based study provides comprehensive analysis of hospitalisations for respiratory conditions, the associated risks of admission by earlier cancer treatment and trends in readmissions and subsequent mortality in long-term survivors of cancers diagnosed under 30 years. The risk of hospitalisation was significantly higher in cancer survivors compared to the general population. Treatment with chemotherapy with known lung toxicity was associated with an increased risk of admissions for all respiratory disease especially pneumonia. Subsequent mortality was highest in those admitted for pneumonia compared to other respiratory conditions.

2. Long term survival after childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: population-based trends in cure and relapse by clinical characteristics
(Smith et al, 2018)

Statistical “cure models” provide additional metrics useful to identify and describe trends in survival. Additional measures include the proportion cured which is a summary of the long term survival and the median survival of the uncured which give information on those who are not long-term survivors. In this study we used a statistical cure model to explore trends in long-term survival and relapse for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) over time and by clinical characteristics. The proportion of patients cured, defined either by overall survival or relapse free survival, has increased over time while there was slight decrease in the median survival time of the uncured. We also observed a significant reduction in the risk of relapse over time.

3. Comparison of ethnic group classification using naming analysis and routinely collected data
(Smith et al, 2017)

In this study we compared cancer incidence trends using different methods for assigning ethnic groups to individuals: 1 – using ethnic group recorded in hospital medical records, 2 – using a naming software program to assign an ethnic group based on the ethnic origins of the individuals and 3 – using a combination of both processes. We found that using different methods of assigning ethnicity can result in different estimates of ethnic variation in cancer incidence. Combining ethnicity from multiple sources results in a more complete estimate of ethnicity than the use of one single source.

Data is de-identified at source (Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust (LTHT) and ResearchOne) and linked using matching pseudonymous digests that are re-pseudonymised upon linkage by University of Leeds IT to produce irreversibly pseudonymous data that is processed into a research dataset. The data relates to the medical history of cancer patients prior to cancer, during their cancer diagnosis and treatment, and following their long-term outcomes, and the medical history of matched non-cancer patients that form a comparator cohort.

The data relates to 431,352 patients in the UK that LTHT have a ‘legitimate patient relationship’ with and that were determined by LTHT to have had a cancer diagnosis between 2004 and 2018 or be a matched non-cancer patient. Where available, data from ResearchOne provides primary care information for these patients. Where the patients were invited to participate in a patient reported outcomes measures survey (PROMS), this status is recorded. Where the patient returned a consented PROMS, the PROMS data will also be available once it has completed the extract, transform and load process. 

The dataset is currently 5.7 GB and further ResearchOne and PROMS data is anticipated. The dataset is arranged as a relational database, with tables linking on the patient level by a pseudonymous digest. Each table is a comma separated values (CSV) file and relates to an event type, such as prescription cost, address history or diagnosis. All patients have an entry (row) in the demographics table; the number of times a patient has an entry in the other tables depends on how many events of that type were recorded for the patient. 

The dataset is split into two files, each with similar table structure; the main dataset contains all patients and the PROMs dataset contains only those in the PROMs cohort (for whom additional PROMs data will be added). Each table has a re-pseudonymised digest field, “Digest2” and an indicator as to whether the patient has data from ResearchOne available, “TPP_Linked” (0 or 1).

This was achieved by establishing a biorepository and clinical research database. The biorepository is housed in the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, directed by Dr John McLauchlan and managed by Dr Sarah McDonald. Samples have been obtained from around 10,000 patients.
Access to samples and data is governed by a Tissue and Data Access Committee (TDAC). These are reviewed for ethical and scientific merit by TDAC and a decision reached. 
Serum and plasma are obtained from all patients in the cohort. Buffy coats are also collected, and DNA can be extracted when required. Additionally, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and PAX gene tubes are held for smaller cohorts of patients. The extensive clinical data collected complements the biorepository and allows selection of samples from patients with characteristics of interest.
Sub-cohorts:
-	Serial samples from patients who were treated as part of the NHS England Early Access Program.
-	Yearly samples from cirrhotic patients (beginning 2015)
-	Spontaneous resolvers
-	Small paediatric cohort
Clinical Data
-	Basic demographics including place of birth and ethnicity
-	History of HCV infection including exposure to risk factors and dates
-	Date of diagnosis, date of first attendance at clinic
-	Co-morbidities and co-medications at time of enrolment
-	Liver disease status and how diagnosed
-	Treatment status at enrolment; 
-	Social history including alcohol, cigarettes, cannabis; BMI
-	HCV RNA status, viral load and genotype/subtype
-	Historical data from the patients' notes regarding previous treatment episodes (dates, regimen, viral loads, outcome) and liver biopsies
-	Laboratory data including imaging and fibroscan;
-	New treatment episodes and changes in liver disease status are recorded over time, as are any newly developed co-morbidities.

The data are collected and coded at each hospital. Administrative information is collected from the central PAS (Patient Administrative System), such as specialty of care, admission and discharge dates. After the patient is discharged the handwritten patient notes are transcribed by clinical coder into medical coding terminology (ICD10 and OPCS).

The data held in PEDW is of interest to public health services since it can provide information regarding both health service utilisation and also the incidence and prevalence of disease. However, since PEDW was created to track hospital activity from the point of view of payments for services, rather than epidemiological analysis, the use of PEDW for public health work is not straightforward. For example:

Counts will vary depending on the number of diagnosis fields used e.g. primary only, all fields;
There are a number of different things that can be counted in PEDW e.g. individual episodes of care, admissions, discharges, periods of continuous care (group of episodes), patients or procedures.
When looking at diagnosis or procedures the number will vary depending on whether you look at only in the primary diagnosis / procedure field or if the secondary fields are also included.
Coding practices vary. In particular, coding practices for recording secondary diagnoses is likely to vary for different hospitals. This makes regional variations more difficult to interpret. The validation process led by the Corporate Health Improvement Programme and implemented by NWIS is aiming to address some of these inconsistencies.

The project is hosted by Cardiff University and receives funding from the Welsh Government, Cancer Research Wales and Velindre Charitable funds.
A Cancer Bank is literally a collection of tissue and blood which has been collected from patients where cancer is a possible diagnosis and is being stored to facilitate future research into cancer.
Statistics suggest that four out of ten people will be diagnosed with cancer at some point during their life. Cancers are complex diseases and it is an on-going quest to understand how they develop, spread and can be treated. The development of more effective, targeted treatment for cancer depends on increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the initiation of the tumour, its progression to metastatic disease and response and resistance to treatment. Research studies rely on the availability of high quality biological material from patients with cancer and large studies are needed to correlate biology with clinical outcome.
The Welsh population is relatively stable and this makes it an ideal cohort to collect and study. Linkage with the all Wales cancer clinical database (CANISC) enables good correlation of science with clinical follow-up. This will eventually enable the results from hundreds of research projects to be integrated and linked to clinical outcome and this will be an invaluable source of data for bioinformatics specialists to examine. All the data collected is being stored on a database housed in the NHS to ensure security and confidentiality.
The WCB currently consents patients in 12 hospitals around Wales with specially trained research nurses and clinical teams.

ALSPAC is a multi-generation prospective cohort based in Bristol in the South West of England. More than 14,000 women (G0) were enrolled in 1991 and 1992. Their partners (also G0), children (G1) and now grandchildren (G2) have been recruited and followed up over multiple timepoints. A wide variety of biological samples have been collected along with a vast array of exposure and outcome data collected via questionnaire, face to face clinics and through linkage to administrative data.

During the index pregnancy women were sent 3 questionnaires. Since then, over a period of some 25 years, women have been sent almost annual questionnaires asking about their own health and well-being. From 2008, women were invited to attend four focus clinical assessments. Assessments of the children have been administered frequently, with multiple data collection time points since birth. These include numerous child-completed questionnaires, a number of clinical assessments from the age of 7 years and further questionnaires about the child completed by the mother or other main caregiver. Partners of the mothers have also completed a number of questionnaires and been invited to one focus clinic assessment. The second generation (children of the children) have been and continue to be recruited with data collected via questionnaire and clinical assessment at multiple time points.

In response, we propose an innovative scientific research program which embraces a truly trans-disciplinary team science approach, and is of fundamental relevance both to biomedical research and to evidence-based health science more broadly. UNICORN builds directly on the substantive prior investments in both the science and infrastructure underpinning research in this domain.

Blood collection
We collect blood from donors aged between 18-60, who have been screened to ensure that it is safe for them to donate, that they are in good health, and not taking medications that might interfere with experiments.
Donors will have given consent for their samples to be used in a wide range of biomedical research applications, including genetic research and that undertaken by commercial organisations.
We are also able to collect samples from specific donors, for example within a certain age range, ethnicity or with a specific blood group. We can collect samples into a wide range of anticoagulant tubes, blood bags and other devices as required.
Processing
We use advanced technologies in our laboratory to test donated blood samples and to process them into the formats which are most useful to researchers. These include:
Whole blood
 From a single tube of whole blood in a specific anticoagulant tube, up to a full bag of blood we can collect the exact volume of blood you need from donors best suited to your study and deliver it within precisely defined timeframes at the best temperature for your need.
Buffy coat
 We routinely process whole blood units into buffy coat preparations which are used as a source of PBMCs by our clients. We can also process smaller volumes of blood from blood collection tubes into buffy coat.
Plasma
 We can either collect a specific volume of blood in the anticoagulant of your choice and prepare plasma, or you can source plasma samples that we have banked from a wide selection of donors for screening purposes.
Serum
 We can either collect a specific volume of blood and prepare serum to suit your needs, or you can select from serum samples that we have previously banked from a wide selection of donors.
PBMCs
 We are preparing PBMCs from whole units of blood within a very short timeframe from venepuncture (typically processing begins within 1 hour). PBMCs are produced using a density centrifugation, characterized and frozen in a proprietary freezing solution designed to maximise cell viability.

This table includes information derived from laboratory_sample and cancer_participant_tumour.\n\n\nSome key data included in the table are elucidated below:\n\n \nGlobal Tumour Mutation Burden\n\nThis is the number of somatic non-synonymous small variants per megabase of coding sequences (32.61 Mb). This metric was calculated using somatic_small_variants_annotation_vcf as input (see below for description) and all non-PASS variants were removed from the calculation.\n\n\n\nTumour purity\n\nThis is the tumour purity (cancer cell fraction) as calculated by Ccube (https://rdrr.io/github/keyuan/ccube/)\n\n\n\nMutational Signatures\n\nThe table includes the relative proportions of the different mutational signatures demonstrated by the tumour. Analysis of large sequencing datasets (10,952 exomes and 1,048 whole-genomes from 40 distinct tumour types) has allowed patterns of relative contextual frequencies of different SNVs to be grouped into specific mutational signatures. Using mathematical methods (decomposition by non-negative least squares) the contribution of each of these signatures to the overall mutation burden observed in a tumour can be derived. Further details of the 30 different mutational signatures used for this analysis, their prevalence in different tumour types and proposed aetiology can be found at the Sanger Institute Website: http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/census.\n\n\n\nCancer PCA QC Statistics\n\nThe cancer analysis pipeline employs a sequencing quality control check which selects several important statistics associated with the sequencing returned by the sequencing provider, and uses them to check whether or not the sample in question is an outlier with respect to previous samples that have been run through the pipeline. It is, in effect, a safety net that can spot issues that have occurred at the tissue collection stage (i.e. at the GMC (Genomic Medicine Centre)) or at the library preparation step (i.e. at the sequencing provider), both of which may impact upon the final genomic analysis returned to the clinician.\n\n\n\nSomatic small variants annotation vcf filepaths\n\nThe somatic_small_variants_annotation_vcf column contains file paths pointing to VCFs containing Genomics England flags for potential false positive variants as well as additional annotations (see VCF header for details).  Swift and PolyPhen scores as well as new PONnoise50SNV flag were added. The flags used for annotation are:\n\ni. CommonGermlineVariant: variants with a population germline allele frequency above 1% in a Genomics England dataset\n\nii. CommonGnomADVariant: variants with a population germline allele frequency above 1% in gnomAD dataset\n\niii. RecurrentSomaticVariant: recurrent somatic variants with frequency above 5% in a Genomics England dataset\n\niv. SimpleRepeat: variants overlapping simple repeats as defined by Tandem Repeats Finder\n\nv. BCNoiseIndel: small indels in regions with high levels of sequencing noise where at least 10% of the basecalls in a window extending 50 bases to either side of the indel’s call have been filtered out by Strelka due to the poor quality\n\nvi. PONnoise50SNV: SNVs resulting from systematic mapping and calling artefacts\n\nThe following methodology was used for the PONnoise50SNV flag: the ratio of tumour allele depths at each somatic SNV site was tested to see if it is significantly different to the ratio of allele depths at this site in a panel of normals (PoN) using Fisher’s exact test. The PoN was composed of a cohort of 7000 non-tumour genomes from the Genomics England dataset, and at each genomic site only individuals not carrying the relevant alternate allele were included in the count of allele depths. The mpileup function in bcftools v1.9 was used to count allele depths in the PoN, and to replicate Strelka filters duplicate reads were removed and quality thresholds set at mapping quality >= 5 and base quality >= 5. All somatic SNVs with a Fisher’s exact test phred score < 50 were filtered, this threshold minimised the loss of true positive variants while still gaining significant improvement in specificity of SNV calling as calculated from a TRACERx truth set.

Carstairs Index: England, Wales and Scotland calculated using 2011 census data.

As standard, the most recent national Indices of Deprivation are provided for each country. It is important to note that the IMD indices are not comparable between countries in the UK. Older versions of the deprivation scores can be provided on request. The data are updated monthly. Data are provided as quintiles or deciles of the deprivation score to prevent disclosure of patient location. In order to prevent the possibility of deductive disclosure of the location of a practice, researchers will only be provided with one of the above linked datasets for any one study.",,,3,CPRDAurum,,"CPRD Aurum linked small area level socio-demographic and socio-economic data mapped to the postcode of the GP practice, including the Index of Multiple Deprivation and Carstairs Index.",,,"Access is provided by CPRD subject to ISAC approval.

The Leeds NIHR Biomarker Research Tissue Bank (RTB) is part of a National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Programme Grants for Applied Research award, focused on biomarker evaluation in selected disease areas.  The RTB was established for the multicentre collection and storage of samples from patients with liver diseases recruited within a randomised controlled trial (ELUCIDATE) of a biomarker panel, renal cancer patients and patients undergoing kidney transplant.
The Leeds NIHR Biomarker RTB is jointly managed along with the Multidisciplinary RTB by the Joint RTB Management Committee. The Leeds NIHR Research Tissue Bank (RTB) was given favourable ethical opinion by the Leeds (East) Research Ethics Committee on 15th June 2010 (Current REC ref: 15/YH/0099).  

Sample collections:
Over the duration of the programme, 2,116 participants were recruited in total with 5,976 samples. Sample collection has taken place in multiple centres in the UK. These comprise:
-	847 patients with liver disease each with a single serum samples 
-	514 patients on the kidney transplant waiting list including 312 subsequently transplanted, with 3,806 samples, each sample including multiple aliquots of serum, plasma and urine
-	706 patients with suspected renal cancer (200 longitudinal and 506 cross-sectional)  with 1,132 samples, including multiple aliquots of serum, plasma, buffy coat and urine and an FFPE tissue block (frozen available in Leeds patients only)
-	149 healthy volunteers with 191 samples, each sample including multiple aliquots of serum, plasma and urine.
All samples were collected according to SOPs and have been shipped from the participating sites and stored centrally in Leeds Biobanking and Sample Processing Facility.  Associated clinical data has been collected using standard study-specific case report forms (CRFs), including long-term follow-up in many cases. 
Initially access to samples is prioritised for the needs of the Programme and investigators involved but additional collaborative access will then be possible.

We have two main collections: the Peninsula Research Bank (PRB) and the Royal Devon and Exeter Tissue Bank (RDETB). 
The PRB has ethics to accept gifted samples from completed studies, and the bulk of the collection is from a dedicated biobank collection called EXTEND (the EXeter TEN thousanD), which aims to recruit one in ten of the local Exeter population. The majority (c. 75%) of our studies are local CI led, and we specialise mainly in diabetes, obesity and related pathologies. However, the majority of people within the EXTEND study are fit and well.
The RDETB has overarching ethics to collect samples from diagnostic procedures with patients' consent. Each collection within the RDETB uses a standardised consent and collection approach to obtain material that would otherwise be destroyed or not retained. There is scope for prospective studies recruiting through the RDETB.
Both collections have a steering committee controlling access, including lay members from within the biobank. There is a standardised approach for requests and the committee sits once a month. In addition, access to gifted samples within the PRB will involve contact with the PI, where possible.
