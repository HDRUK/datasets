The summary of our data is described using a codebook consisting of codes and the description used to analyse the focus groups/interviews. The codebook was developed using open codes, categories (collation of open codes) and themes. We used this codebook to aid in constructing a schema to inform the development of the CuT-AsthMa programme. Other documents include an invitation letter to participants, a set of participant information sheet and consent. The data in this study is to support part of the PhD work at the Usher Institute, the University of Edinburgh.

This was achieved by establishing a biorepository and clinical research database. The biorepository is housed in the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, directed by Dr John McLauchlan and managed by Dr Sarah McDonald. Samples have been obtained from around 10,000 patients.
Access to samples and data is governed by a Tissue and Data Access Committee (TDAC). These are reviewed for ethical and scientific merit by TDAC and a decision reached. 
Serum and plasma are obtained from all patients in the cohort. Buffy coats are also collected, and DNA can be extracted when required. Additionally, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and PAX gene tubes are held for smaller cohorts of patients. The extensive clinical data collected complements the biorepository and allows selection of samples from patients with characteristics of interest.
Sub-cohorts:
-	Serial samples from patients who were treated as part of the NHS England Early Access Program.
-	Yearly samples from cirrhotic patients (beginning 2015)
-	Spontaneous resolvers
-	Small paediatric cohort
Clinical Data
-	Basic demographics including place of birth and ethnicity
-	History of HCV infection including exposure to risk factors and dates
-	Date of diagnosis, date of first attendance at clinic
-	Co-morbidities and co-medications at time of enrolment
-	Liver disease status and how diagnosed
-	Treatment status at enrolment; 
-	Social history including alcohol, cigarettes, cannabis; BMI
-	HCV RNA status, viral load and genotype/subtype
-	Historical data from the patients' notes regarding previous treatment episodes (dates, regimen, viral loads, outcome) and liver biopsies
-	Laboratory data including imaging and fibroscan;
-	New treatment episodes and changes in liver disease status are recorded over time, as are any newly developed co-morbidities.

In India, use of spirometry among physicians and researchers to diagnose OADs is increasing day by day. Predictive values generated based on healthy population are used in interpretation of spirometry data. Currently, in India, most of the predicted values used in the spirometry data interpretation are based on predictive values from western populations. As no predictive values are available for the Indian population, physicians and researchers from India depend on the western countries guidelines such as ERS, ECHRS for the predictive values. A few attempts have been made to generate the predictive values for Indian population, but no conclusion has been drawn. We propose to use spirometry data from 2,500 adults from Vadu Health and Demographic Surveillance System (Vadu HDSS) population to develop the predictive values for the Western Indian population.

The Leeds NIHR Biomarker Research Tissue Bank (RTB) is part of a National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Programme Grants for Applied Research award, focused on biomarker evaluation in selected disease areas.  The RTB was established for the multicentre collection and storage of samples from patients with liver diseases recruited within a randomised controlled trial (ELUCIDATE) of a biomarker panel, renal cancer patients and patients undergoing kidney transplant.
The Leeds NIHR Biomarker RTB is jointly managed along with the Multidisciplinary RTB by the Joint RTB Management Committee. The Leeds NIHR Research Tissue Bank (RTB) was given favourable ethical opinion by the Leeds (East) Research Ethics Committee on 15th June 2010 (Current REC ref: 15/YH/0099).  

Sample collections:
Over the duration of the programme, 2,116 participants were recruited in total with 5,976 samples. Sample collection has taken place in multiple centres in the UK. These comprise:
-	847 patients with liver disease each with a single serum samples 
-	514 patients on the kidney transplant waiting list including 312 subsequently transplanted, with 3,806 samples, each sample including multiple aliquots of serum, plasma and urine
-	706 patients with suspected renal cancer (200 longitudinal and 506 cross-sectional)  with 1,132 samples, including multiple aliquots of serum, plasma, buffy coat and urine and an FFPE tissue block (frozen available in Leeds patients only)
-	149 healthy volunteers with 191 samples, each sample including multiple aliquots of serum, plasma and urine.
All samples were collected according to SOPs and have been shipped from the participating sites and stored centrally in Leeds Biobanking and Sample Processing Facility.  Associated clinical data has been collected using standard study-specific case report forms (CRFs), including long-term follow-up in many cases. 
Initially access to samples is prioritised for the needs of the Programme and investigators involved but additional collaborative access will then be possible.

It is, however, neglected. Most patients have poor knowledge about asthma and despite the availability of effective treatment, asthma control is reported to be unsatisfactory. Disease management and prevention is suboptimal and has an impact on the economic burden. As not much is known about what actually contributes to poor asthma control in our region, improving understanding on factors related to disease burden could contribute significantly to improved asthma morbidity. The aim of this project is to develop a cohort of adults and children with asthma in Klang district in Malaysia to enable epidemiology, disease management and economic burden of asthma to be studied and interventions directed at patients and health care practice level to be carried out to improve asthma care.

Quantitative data is collected from GPs practising in study area to understand their qualification and type of practice and their involvement in asthma & COPD diagnosis and management. Qualitative data is collected from few GPs (using in depth interview tools) in study area who has good experience about diagnosis and management of asthma & COPD. Their perceptions and practices about their clinical practice are documented.

Long-term lung conditions, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), are very common and can affect people’s well-being, and ability to work and care for their families.

Respiratory symptoms are common but weak primary health care systems in resource-poor countries are often unable to diagnose the underlying disease condition, leading to inappropriate treatment. A lack of diagnosis also means the true burden of the disease is not appreciated.

To improve treatment of these conditions, we first need to understand how primary care doctors (who provide the majority of healthcare for rural populations in India) diagnose and treat people with chest symptoms, what makes it difficult for them to provide good care and how they think care can be improved.

We aim to repurpose and expand an existing pandemic reporting platform to determine the attack rate of SARS-CoV-2, the uptake and effectiveness of any new pandemic vaccine (once available) and any protective effect conferred by existing or new antimicrobial drugs and other therapies.

Methods and analysis: A prospective observational cohort will be used to monitor daily/weekly the progress of the COVID-19 epidemic and to evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions in approximately 5.4?million individuals registered in general practices across Scotland. A national linked dataset of patient-level primary care data, out-of-hours, hospitalisation, mortality and laboratory data will be assembled. The primary outcomes will measure association between: (A) laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, morbidity and mortality, and demographic, socioeconomic and clinical population characteristics; and (B) healthcare burden of COVID-19 and demographic, socioeconomic and clinical population characteristics. The secondary outcomes will estimate: (A) the uptake (for vaccines only); (B) effectiveness; and (C) safety of new or existing therapies, vaccines and antimicrobials against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The association between population characteristics and primary outcomes will be assessed via multivariate logistic regression models. The effectiveness of therapies, vaccines and antimicrobials will be assessed from time-dependent Cox models or Poisson regression models. Self-controlled study designs will be explored to estimate the risk of therapeutic and prophylactic-related adverse events.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by the build-up of scar tissue in the lungs. It is believed that the damage to the alveolar epithelium is followed by an aberrant wound healing response leading to the deposition of dense fibrotic tissue, reducing the lungs’ flexibility and inhibiting gas transfer. IPF still has limited therapeutic interventions and a high mortality rate within 3-5 years from diagnosis. To date, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of IPF susceptibility have associated common variants (minor allele frequency [MAF]>5%) near genes involved in host defence, telomere maintenance, cell-cell adhesion and signalling in disease susceptibility. 
Meta-analysis of GWAS of IPF susceptibility. Building up on published GWAS results (PMID: 24429156, 23583980, 29066090) and novel study samples, we have performed the largest GWAS of IPF susceptibility to date to identify novel genes and further advance in the understanding of IPF pathogenesis and risk (bioRxiv https://doi.org/10.1101/636761 and PMID:31710517).

South Asian children are more at risk of dying due to infections attributed to highly prevalent deadly yet preventable childhood infections. Alongside concerns about the prevalence of these infections, there has been a renewed interest in involving community health workers (CHWs) in various public health programs. However, as CHWs are increasingly asked to take on different tasks there is a risk that their workload may become unmanageable. One approach to help reduce this burden is the use of mobile technology-based healthcare solutions (mHealth) in the community. We aimed to appraise the available literature on CHW based mHealth approaches for caregivers to improve knowledge and management about common childhood infections and to develop a mobile application which lady health workers (LHWs) will use in their monthly visits to counsel caregivers on inder five pneumonia.

The UK MND Collections combines more than 3,000 biological samples and accompanying clinical information; as well as epidemiology data from 400 participants, including people with MND, controls and family members.
The DNA Bank was the original Collection of whole genome DNA from over 3,000 blood samples, which are stored at CIGMR (Centre for Integrated Genomic Medical Research) in Manchester, UK. The DNA Bank also has clinical information (divided into a minimum and extended dataset) which is available to researchers.
The Cell Lines Collection offers a sub set of the DNA Bank samples as EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes. This was originally set up as an everlasting supply of DNA, with the lymphoblastoid cell lines now available to researchers to help them understand how the disease is developing.
The Epidemiology Collection has just over 200 patient and matched control blood samples with extensive environmental and lifestyle data (both from self-report questionnaires and telephone interviews) available to researchers.

Evidence shows that COVID-19 infected patients with pneumonia may present on chest x-rays with a pattern that is difficult to characterise using only the human eye. Therefore, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques using deep learning, which can consistently identify infected patients from non-infected ones given a radiographic examination of the patient, can be used as a reliable diagnostic tool. Considering chest x-rays are one of the most commonly performed radiological studies (coupled with the near universal availability of testing machines), applying AI techniques on them could prove to be valuable for COVID-19 diagnosis during clinical management. We therefore aim to establish a reliable diagnostic tool based on a deep-learning framework for the screening of patients who present with COVID-19 related abnormalities on chest x-rays. Over the course of 7 months we will build a dataset using open source data which are freely available, as well as with de-identified patient data collected from health institutions in Pakistan. Using this dataset, a deep learning model will be trained, which would be able to accurately screen patients who present with abnormalities relevant to COVID-19 in their radiographic examination. This tool will ultimately aid in expediting the diagnosis and referral of COVID-19 patients, resulting in improved clinical outcomes.

It is an Office for National Statistics standard classification.
To assign a person aged 16 and over to an NS-SeC category, their occupation title is combined with information about their employment status, whether they are employed or self-employed, and whether or not they supervise other employees. Full-time students are recorded in the ‘full-time students' category regardless of whether they are economically active or not.
Although all people aged 16 and over are assigned to a NS-SeC category, statistical outputs for this variable are generally based on the 16 to 74 years old population due to statistical disclosure control considerations.
The rebased version of NS-SeC used in census results uses occupation coded to SOC2010. Information about the classification is available: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/classifications/current-standard-classifications/soc2010/index.html. In 2011 Census results, because the census did not ask a question about the number of employees at a person's workplace, the reduced method of deriving NS-SeC (which does not require this information) is used.
The concept of a Household Reference Person (HRP) was introduced in the 2001 Census (in common with other government surveys in 2001/2) to replace the traditional concept of the 'head of the household'.

For example, in India, lung cancer often emerges on a background of chronic respiratory symptoms and is often not diagnosed at all – or at a very late stage. Because of late presentation and a range of other factors, survival from lung cancer in India is very low. At present we know very little about how knowledge and attitudes relating to CRD in poor, rural populations in India might be influenced by health and behavioural interventions. Psychological theory-based interventions must be culturally appropriate and grounded in the local context. As such, it’s vital we develop this understanding if we are to change behaviours and reduce exposure to common risk factors, such as smoking and indoor cooking smoke.

The PhD study aims to gather evidence through systematic review of literature about TPB based health interventions and conduct qualitative studies to inform the which constructs of TPB are important in developing an educational intervention which can effectively change the knowledge, attitude and health behaviour of people with CRD in these low resource settings.

Genetics can strongly influence this response, as well as the initial propensity to obesity. Several genes have been implicated but more in-depth mechanistic studies are needed to understand how genes affect energy regulation and mediate the beneficial effects of bariatric surgery.
The Obesity Research Biobank Syndicate (ORBiS) aims to fulfil this need. It provides a comprehensive collection of high-quality biological samples and patient data to facilitate mechanistic research and help translate it to improved treatments for patients. 
Patients undergoing bariatric surgery are recruited from multiple centres in the UK. With informed consent, blood or saliva samples are collected pre-operatively and tissue collected during surgery. Samples include: adipose tissue (subcutaneous and visceral), muscle, liver, stomach and small intestine. Relevant clinical and demographic data are linked and stored pseudo anonymised in a secure database. Tissue collections are transported to and processed in the ORBiS laboratory at University College London, and stored at UCL-Royal Free Hospital Biobank for future use.

Dataset contains qualitative interviews from phase 2, responses to quantitative questionnaire and qualitative interviews in phase 3. 

Supported self-management for asthma (including action plans and regular review) is highly effective at improving asthma control, reducing acute attacks and the need for unscheduled healthcare. However, globally it is challenging to implement self-management in patients with asthma. One particular challenge is the need to tailor support for people with limited health literacy especially in low and middle income countries (LMICs) such as in Malaysia. In 2015,  it was estimated that more than 90% of the Malaysian general population have limited health literacy. A tailored asthma self-management intervention, paying attention to the needs of people with limited health literacy, potentially could lessen health inequalities in Malaysia. This study is conducted in 3 phases. Phase 1 is a systematic review looking at effectiveness of asthma self-management interventions which address health literacy needs. We found gap in this area of knowledge. In phase 2, we conducted mixed qualitative and Photovoice, an arts-based qualitative study to explore lived experience of people living with asthma and limited health literacy in Malaysia. We found rich data on challenges and enablers around psychosocial themes on how people views asthma, self-management and experienced health literacy.  We also explore the potential of technology i.e. mobile application to tailor asthma self-management support. Based on phase 2 findings, in phase 3, we developed and refined an asthma self-management mobile application with feedback from patients and health care professionals through a intervention design workshop which was conducted online.

This may often take the form of a dashboard and quality improvement activity, domain related but under the editorial control of RCGP RSC.

Any potential costs will be discussed at the monthly RCGP RSC Operational meeting, held each month, and researchers will be contacted as soon after the meeting as possible. Data extraction can start once these costs have been through a University approval process and formal agreements are in place.For studies requiring active participation of General Practices, a contribution to cover practice staff members’ time and expenses will be expected.

The project is hosted by Cardiff University and receives funding from the Welsh Government, Cancer Research Wales and Velindre Charitable funds.
A Cancer Bank is literally a collection of tissue and blood which has been collected from patients where cancer is a possible diagnosis and is being stored to facilitate future research into cancer.
Statistics suggest that four out of ten people will be diagnosed with cancer at some point during their life. Cancers are complex diseases and it is an on-going quest to understand how they develop, spread and can be treated. The development of more effective, targeted treatment for cancer depends on increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the initiation of the tumour, its progression to metastatic disease and response and resistance to treatment. Research studies rely on the availability of high quality biological material from patients with cancer and large studies are needed to correlate biology with clinical outcome.
The Welsh population is relatively stable and this makes it an ideal cohort to collect and study. Linkage with the all Wales cancer clinical database (CANISC) enables good correlation of science with clinical follow-up. This will eventually enable the results from hundreds of research projects to be integrated and linked to clinical outcome and this will be an invaluable source of data for bioinformatics specialists to examine. All the data collected is being stored on a database housed in the NHS to ensure security and confidentiality.
The WCB currently consents patients in 12 hospitals around Wales with specially trained research nurses and clinical teams.

It aims to understand the relationship between COVID-19 and cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack, heart failure, stroke, and blood clots in the lungs through analyses of de-identified, pseudonymised, linked, nationally collated healthcare datasets across the four nations of the UK.

CVD-COVID-UK is a collaboration of over 130 members across 40 institutions including data custodians, data scientists with methodological and analytical expertise and clinicians, all of whom have signed up to an agreed set of principles with an inclusive, open and transparent ethos.

Approved researchers will access datasets within secure trusted research environments (TREs) provided by NHS Digital in England, the National Data Safe Haven in Scotland, the SAIL Databank in Wales and the Honest Broker Service in Northern Ireland.

Datasets are available across primary and secondary care, COVID testing, deaths, ITU/HDU admissions, prescribing/dispensing, cardiovascular audits (NICOR), stroke audits (SSNAP) and national vascular registry.

A list of datasets currently available in each nation’s TRE can be found on associated BHF Data Science Centre webpages (URL as below).",,DataModel,False,,True,,https://www.geonames.org/countries/GB/united-kingdom.html,CVD-COVID-UK,6ec3a47b-447a-4b22-9b7a-43acae5d408f,,2021-02-17T17:53:10Z,"GB-ENG,GB-SCT,GB-WLS","BHF,CVD-COVID-UK,BHF DSC,BHF Data Science Centre,TRE,Trusted Research Environment,CVD,COVID,COVID-19,Coronavirus,Linked,LINKABLE,Cardiovascular,England,Scotland,Wales,GDPPR,HES,SUS,Dataset,SGSS,SSNAP,Death register,EHR,CHESS,NHSD,NHS Digital,SAIL,Safe Haven,ICNARC,Heart,Heart disease,Myocardial,Stroke,Vascular,venous,Dispensing,Prescribing,Primary Care,Secondary Care,SARS-CoV-2,SICSAG,SICSAG,SMR00,SMR01,ECOSS,APC,Outpatients,MINAP,PCI,NICOR,PEDW","Trusted Research Environments for CVD-COVID-UK in England, Scotland and Wales",en,,6ec3a47b-447a-4b22-9b7a-43acae5d408f,,,,,2021-02-17T17:50:28Z,,,MONTHLY,NOT AVAILABLE,7e5f0247-f033-4f98-aed3-3d7422b9dc6d,,OTHER > BHF Data Science Centre,,,"Trusted Research Environments for CVD-COVID-UK in England, Scotland and Wales",Data Asset,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HDRUK/schemata/master/schema/dataset/1.1.7/dataset.schema.json,0.0.1

ALSPAC is a multi-generation prospective cohort based in Bristol in the South West of England. More than 14,000 women (G0) were enrolled in 1991 and 1992. Their partners (also G0), children (G1) and now grandchildren (G2) have been recruited and followed up over multiple timepoints. A wide variety of biological samples have been collected along with a vast array of exposure and outcome data collected via questionnaire, face to face clinics and through linkage to administrative data.

During the index pregnancy women were sent 3 questionnaires. Since then, over a period of some 25 years, women have been sent almost annual questionnaires asking about their own health and well-being. From 2008, women were invited to attend four focus clinical assessments. Assessments of the children have been administered frequently, with multiple data collection time points since birth. These include numerous child-completed questionnaires, a number of clinical assessments from the age of 7 years and further questionnaires about the child completed by the mother or other main caregiver. Partners of the mothers have also completed a number of questionnaires and been invited to one focus clinic assessment. The second generation (children of the children) have been and continue to be recruited with data collected via questionnaire and clinical assessment at multiple time points.

The study has multiple datasets arranged by cohort member, data type (usually questionnaire or clinic) and time point.

Lung function is an important indicator of respiratory health and mortality. Measures of lung function show irreversible airway obstruction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a progressive condition affecting 900,000 people in the UK. Smoking is a strong risk factor for COPD but not all smokers are equally susceptible. Genetic approaches to understanding the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of good lungs aim to reveal previously unknown molecular targets for drug development and to facilitate stratified approaches to treatment and care. This project aims to detect rare genetic variants associated with lung function. Once discovered, such variants tend to exert a large effect on disease risk and provide a means to translate findings from genetic studies of lung function to clinical relevant research and development. The proposed study leverages the power of Uk Biobank and respiratory genomics to advance understanding of lung function and COPD.",In Progress,DataModel,False,,True,Tab delimited text,United Kingdom,NOT APPLICABLE,73462506-32c5-43a0-963e-06d67e967b97,UKBiLEVE,2020-01-13T15:48:21Z,GB,"GWAS,LUNG FUNCTION,COPD,UKBiLEVE,UK BIOBANK,BREATHE",UK BiLEVE Consortium Dataset,en,,73462506-32c5-43a0-963e-06d67e967b97,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/about,Linkage to other UK Biobank data feasible via an application to UK Biobank: https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/register-apply/,,,2021-03-02T17:52:56Z,,,STATIC,NOT AVAILABLE,b8bcda0b-3c90-4382-aeb7-b01fc27e58fa,"Volunteers in the UK, enrolled at ages from 40 to 69. 502,682 individuals (UK Biobank) - 321,047 individuals (with lung function phenotype).",HUB > BREATHE,2019-02-25T00:00:00Z,321047,UK BiLEVE Consortium Dataset,Data Asset,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HDRUK/schemata/master/schema/dataset/1.1.7/dataset.schema.json,4.0.0

For example, in India, lung cancer often emerges on a background of chronic respiratory symptoms and is often not diagnosed at all – or at a very late stage. Because of late presentation and a range of other factors, survival from lung cancer in India is very low. At present we know very little about how knowledge and attitudes relating to CRD in poor, rural populations in India might be influenced by health and behavioural interventions. Similarly, compliance with treatments offered is poorly understood. Psychological theory-based interventions must be culturally appropriate and grounded in the local context. As such, it’s vital we develop our understanding if we are to change behaviours and reduce exposure to common risk factors, such as smoking and indoor cooking smoke.                         

The project will determine the feasibility of an intervention study of Health Care Worker (HCW)-delivered respiratory package including health education drawing on psychological theory of planned behaviour in the intervention arm and Health Belief Model in control arm and delivery of treatment and follow-up.

The Leeds Biobanking and Sample Processing Lab (LBSPL) is based at St James's University Hospital and is an important element in the Leeds Clinical Research Facility (LCRF). LBSPL is dedicated to providing a sample processing service for clinical trials, and for many biobanking activities within the University and Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust.  These currently include collections of tissue, and fluid samples such as blood and urine obtained from consented patients diagnosed with kidney, bladder, colorectal and ovarian cancer, brain tumours, and patients undergoing renal transplant. These are processed and stored in research tissue banks (Leeds Multidisciplinary RTB and Leeds NIHR Biomarker RTB) and used as a valuable resource for wider research activities.
The Leeds Multidisciplinary Research Tissue Bank (RTB) was given favourable ethical opinion by the Leeds (East) Research Ethics Committee on 3rd March 2010 and renewed 5 years later (Current REC ref: 15/YH/0080).  

Current situation:
The LBSPL provides ongoing sample processing support to a variety of local or commercial clinical trials requiring samples to be collected for PK/PD endpoints or other associated translational studies. The Leeds Multidisciplinary RTB currently holds matched normal and malignant frozen renal tissue samples from ~600 patients with renal cancer, and plasma, serum, buffy coat and urine samples from ~800 renal cancer patients either prior to surgery/treatment or during treatment, for example with sunitinib. In addition, fluid samples have been collected from patients with benign urological conditions, healthy controls, patients prior to and following renal transplant A population-based TMA including tissue from ~300 RCC patients has also been established. From having solely a renal focus, the RTB has expanded to now also include frozen normal tissue samples, and frozen tissue and urine samples from >1,000 patients with bladder cancer, frozen tissue from patients with brain tumours and limited samples from patients with ovarian cancer or colorectal cancer (no new collections ongoing in these areas). The Leeds NIHR BioRTB has closed to recruitment and contains a bank of fluid samples from patients with liver disease, renal cancer and patient undergoing renal transplantation. These were collected as part of a multicentre initiative in the UK, together with associated clinical data, and are intended for use in biomarker validation studies.  

Sample processing and clinical data:
Samples are processed according to the relevant quality controlled Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) within Good Clinical Practice (GCLP) laboratories. The dedicated sample processing team of laboratory technicians, administrative staff and a Quality Assurance manager works together to ensure that all samples are handled, processed, stored and tracked to the highest standards. The samples are stored accordingly at the correct temperature (e.g. snap frozen tissue in liquid nitrogen, plasma, serum and buffy coats at -80oC). All freezers and liquid nitrogen dewars which hold patient samples are monitored using the Tutela system, a 24/7 web-based alert response temperature monitoring system.
Full clinical data is being collected using CRFs. Follow-up data and data available later such as pathology results are obtained from the relevant hospital records/databases by trained personnel with appropriate access. We hope to move to more automated data linkage in the future through working with the Leeds Institute of Data Analytics.

The survey was conducted by Quality Health in conjunction with cancer registries. The survey measures overall quality of life of representative samples of cancer survivors with four different tumour types (breast, colorectal and prostate cancer and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL)) and at four different time points after diagnosis (approximately one, two, three or five years). 

The survey was a small pilot survey that sent questionnaires to approximately 5000 patients, 1248 patients for each cancer site.
Responses were obtained (n=3300) of individuals approach to participant, giving a response rate of 66%. Outcome questions in the survey are made up of three instruments: the EQ-5D (Euroqol 5 level), FACT (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy) items and SDI (Social Difficulties Inventory).
The survey was repeated in 2012 by sending the same questionnaire again to the same cohort of patients, with an 85% response rate.

There are eight tables of data included in this dataset - four tables for the responses to the 2011 questionnaire (one each for each cancer site, as the questions asked were site specific) and four for the responses to the 2012 questionnaire
As the 2011 and 2012 questionnaires for each cancer site were identical, there are four tables to request data in this data dictionary, one for each cancer site.  
Each table has two columns to request data, one from the initial survey and one from the follow-up survey.

Definition
Ready-for-discharge date is the date on which a hospital inpatient is clinically ready to move on to a more appropriate care setting. This is determined by the consultant/GP responsible for the inpatient medical care in consultation with all agencies involved in planning the patients discharge, both NHS and non-NHS (Multi-Disciplinary Team). The Team must be satisfied that it is safe and reasonable to transfer/discharge the patient. A patient who continues to occupy a hospital bed after his/her ready-for-discharge date during the SAME inpatient episode experiences a delayed discharge.

Recording Rules
The full date should be entered thus:
2 August 2004 =

0	2	0	8	0	4
Notes

“A more appropriate care setting” covers all appropriate destinations outwith short-stay specialties and outwith the NHS (patient’s home, nursing home etc).
From a service provider’s perspective an “appropriate care setting” can be defined as a place that:

Meets the particular care needs of a person.
Meets those needs cost effectively.

If a patient who is clinically ready for discharge is being transferred for non-clinical reasons to another NHS facility whilst awaiting final discharge (which will result in the start of another NHS episode) i.e. to free up short-stay beds, the original Ready for Discharge date should be recorded.
Points to Note

This item is a core criterion of the national standard definition of delayed discharge contained in MEL(2000)07. It can be used to measure duration of delay by looking at the time elapsed between ""Ready for Discharge Date"" and the actual date of discharge.
ICD10 codes can be used in the clinical section to indicate reason for delay in discharge, e.g. living alone - Z60.2.
SMR02 - Mother staying in hospital because baby is in Neonatal Unit. An SMR02 should be completed to cover the entire episode. Complete Ready for Discharge Date and routine clinical coding for the delivery episode. In addition, use Z39.2 (routine postpartum follow-up) and Z76.3 (healthy person accompanying sick person) to indicate the reasons for delayed discharge. If the mother returns to hospital to be with a sick baby more than 10 days after the delivery, she is a nonpatient and no SMR02 should be completed.
Cross Checks

Ready for Discharge Date is checked to be in sequence with other dates.
Ready for Discharge Date must not be present for all types of day cases.

Blood collection
We collect blood from donors aged between 18-60, who have been screened to ensure that it is safe for them to donate, that they are in good health, and not taking medications that might interfere with experiments.
Donors will have given consent for their samples to be used in a wide range of biomedical research applications, including genetic research and that undertaken by commercial organisations.
We are also able to collect samples from specific donors, for example within a certain age range, ethnicity or with a specific blood group. We can collect samples into a wide range of anticoagulant tubes, blood bags and other devices as required.
Processing
We use advanced technologies in our laboratory to test donated blood samples and to process them into the formats which are most useful to researchers. These include:
Whole blood
 From a single tube of whole blood in a specific anticoagulant tube, up to a full bag of blood we can collect the exact volume of blood you need from donors best suited to your study and deliver it within precisely defined timeframes at the best temperature for your need.
Buffy coat
 We routinely process whole blood units into buffy coat preparations which are used as a source of PBMCs by our clients. We can also process smaller volumes of blood from blood collection tubes into buffy coat.
Plasma
 We can either collect a specific volume of blood in the anticoagulant of your choice and prepare plasma, or you can source plasma samples that we have banked from a wide selection of donors for screening purposes.
Serum
 We can either collect a specific volume of blood and prepare serum to suit your needs, or you can select from serum samples that we have previously banked from a wide selection of donors.
PBMCs
 We are preparing PBMCs from whole units of blood within a very short timeframe from venepuncture (typically processing begins within 1 hour). PBMCs are produced using a density centrifugation, characterized and frozen in a proprietary freezing solution designed to maximise cell viability.

The ATF also houses both cell and gene therapy manufacturing units.
Samples are collected, processed and stored (or released) from patients in a variety of disease settings in response to local demand and research strategies in order to facilitate existing research and enable future research areas to be developed. Samples may comprise adult or paediatric tissue which is waste, or surplus to diagnosis taken at the time of surgery or treatment, additional samples taken specifically for research purposes, material taken from patients enrolled in clinical trials, and control material. The HBRC works with local researchers and carries out bespoke tissue collections. All samples can be annotated with the appropriate clinical data which makes them scientifically useful. 
Although the HBRC is primarily a resource for local researchers within CMDS and local NHS Trusts, applications from other UK research groups and the commercial sector are also considered. The policy and procedures associated with the review of these applications, and the subsequent release of samples and associated data, are the same for both internal and external applicants. All samples and associated data are released for research in a fully anonymised form, and a Tissue Transfer Agreement ensures that they will only be used for the purposes approved at release and will not be transferred without written permission.

1.	 Create a national Kidney Bio Bank for collection and storage of biological samples from 3,000 CKD patients and up > 800 NS patients, to provide a strategic resource for fundamental and translational research.
2.	Develop and implement proactive UK protocol driven cohort studies in CKD and NS to investigate determinants of and risk factors for clinically important adverse outcomes.
3.	Engage patient cohorts, with consent to approach for any future research study.
NURTuRE Objectives:
1.	The provision of comprehensive clinical and laboratory data from cohort studies.
2.	The provision of high quality bio-samples with centralised storage/retrieval.
3.	To carry out core biomarker analysis of biopsy specimens in biofluids of all patients recruited and parallel assessment.
4.	Follow-up specimen collection.

It has been found that wrist-worn accelerometers can explain about 44% to 47% of the variation in PA energy expenditure as measured by doubly labelled water. For analysis, it is recommended to only include participants whose accelerometer data could be successfully calibrated, meaning that different devices provide comparable data outputs. It is also recommended to exclude participants with >1% clipped values, which occur when the sensor’s dynamic range of ±8 g is exceeded before or after calibration. In addition, it is recommended to exclude participants with implausibly high activity values, defined as average vector magnitude scores of >100 mg. Participants with insufficient wear-time should be excluded, defined as the unavailability of at least 72 hours of data or who lacked data for every 1-hour period of the 24-hour cycle (scattered over multiple days). This normally results in ~96,600 participants with accelerometer data for epidemiological analysis (see https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003487) .

Researchers typically extract total volume of physical activity, measured as the average vector magnitude in milli-gravity (mg) units. The metric, average vector magnitude, has demonstrated good face validity in the UK Biobank (activity: 7.5% lower per decade of age) and has been validated against doubly labelled water which is a gold-standard measure for energy expenditure.

Researchers have also developed reproducible machine learning methods to infer time spent asleep, in sedentary behaviour, in light intensity activity, and in moderate intensity activity (see https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.10.20227769v3 )",,DataModel,False,,True,Time series CWA format,Great Britain,,aecc1328-3c30-4eff-9f56-ae1278846ef9,,2021-01-15T14:50:25Z,GB-GBN,Accelerometer,Accelerometer,en,,aecc1328-3c30-4eff-9f56-ae1278846ef9,,,,,2021-03-19T14:01:02Z,,,STATIC,NOT AVAILABLE,ceab57e8-1e13-499b-a8f4-6ad60dad3721,,ALLIANCE > UK BIOBANK,,,Accelerometer,Data Asset,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HDRUK/schemata/master/schema/dataset/1.1.7/dataset.schema.json,1.0.0

One of the key approaches to containing COVID-19 has been self-quarantine and social distancing, which although is the need of the day but not easy to manage posing multiple challenges especially in a Pakistani community which follows strong cultural and social beliefs. It is, therefore important to identify the perception, practice and attitude of the community towards containing this disease. These insights are important for national health officials planning to implement control measures in an existing diverse socio-cultural system, an aspect which has been highlighted in the National Action Plan (NAP) for COVID-19 in Pakistan, published on 13th March 2020.

It is dedicated to facilitation of clinical and translational research.
We have two main collections: the Peninsula Research Bank (PRB) and the Royal Devon and Exeter Tissue Bank (RDETB). 
The PRB has ethics to accept gifted samples from completed studies, and the bulk of the collection is from a dedicated biobank collection called EXTEND (the EXeter TEN thousanD), which aims to recruit one in ten of the local Exeter population. The majority (c. 75%) of our studies are local CI led, and we specialise mainly in diabetes, obesity and related pathologies. However, the majority of people within the EXTEND study are fit and well.
The RDETB has overarching ethics to collect samples from diagnostic procedures with patients' consent. Each collection within the RDETB uses a standardised consent and collection approach to obtain material that would otherwise be destroyed or not retained. There is scope for prospective studies recruiting through the RDETB.
Both collections have a steering committee controlling access, including lay members from within the biobank. There is a standardised approach for requests and the committee sits once a month. In addition, access to gifted samples within the PRB will involve contact with the PI, where possible. Some studies have additional steering committees where they have been carried out in consortia with other centres.

Contact the RESPIRE team: https://www.ed.ac.uk/usher/respire/about/projects,>18,,,,LOCAL,RESPIRE@ed.ac.uk,LOCAL,RESPIRE Collaboration,0,RESPIRE,,RESPIRE,,2019-06-30,2018-09-01,Not Available,"The ever evolving role of ASHA demands an up-to-date comprehensive assessment of the workload, incentives and understanding of the work profile from the perspectives of the health system, community and ASHA herself in order to guide successful future implementation as well as sustainability of the programme. This study had a broad interest in both the full range of tasks and the different situations in which ASHA work and the changing context in which their role is interpreted. This study therefore used a mixed-methods approach to assess and explore ASHAs’ perspectives of their workload alongside that of local healthcare colleagues in both rural and village contexts.

Background: 
Globally, Community Health Workers (CHWs) are integral contributors to many health systems. In India, Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) have been deployed since 2005. Engaged in multiple health care activities, they are a key link between the health system and population. ASHAs are expected to participate in new health programmes, prompting interest in their current workload from the perspective of the health system, community and their family.   
  
Methods: 
This mixed methods design study was conducted in rural and tribal Primary Health Centers (PHCs), in Pune district, Western Maharashtra, India. All ASHAs affiliated with these PHCs were invited to participate in the quantitative study, those agreeing to contribute in-depth interviews (IDI) were enrolled in an additional qualitative study. Key informants’ interviews  were conducted with the Auxiliary Nurse Midwife, Block Facilitators and Medical Officers of the same PHCs. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data were analysed thematically.

Results: 
We recruited 67 ASHAs from the two PHCs.  ASHAs worked up to 20 hours/week in their village of residence, serving populations of  approximately 800-1200, embracing an increasing range of activities, despite a workload that contributed to feelings of being rushed and constant tiredness. They juggled household work, other paid  jobs and their ASHA activities. Practical problems with travel added to time involved, especially in tribal areas where transport is lacking. Their sense of benefiting the community and respect and recognition in village brought happiness and job satisfaction. They were willing to take on new tasks. ASHAs perceived themselves as voluntary community health workers rather than as ""health activists.""

Conclusions:
ASHAs were struggling to balance their significant ASHA workload, and domestic tasks. They were proud of their role as CHWs and willing to take on new activities. Strategies to recruit, train, enhance skills, incentivise, and retain ASHAs, need to be prioritised. Evolving attitudes to the advantages/disadvantages of the current voluntary status of ASHAs need to be understood and addressed in terms of working arrangements if ASHAs are to be remain a key component in achieving universal health coverage.

Quantitative dataset have questionnaire and spirometry data collected from randomly selected adult population. Whereas the qualitative data contains in depth interview data collected from patient, physician and different stakeholders from private and public health system in rural part of India. The purpose of this dataset collected is to assess the burden of CRD and its social and economic impact on the community and health system.

Chronic Respiratory Diseases (CRD) especially asthma & Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) are common public health problems with high prevalence and mortality rates across the world. Although the majority of deaths and disability occur in developing countries, there is very little data on the true prevalence of asthma and COPD in these countries. Chronic respiratory symptoms are common in the general population but weak primary health care systems in resource-poor countries are often unable to diagnose the underlying disease condition. Factors contributing to low rates of diagnosis include limited access to, negative perceptions of, and lack of diagnostic capability in healthcare facilities. Determining the prevalence of asthma & COPD in the community has remained a challenge because of the poor sensitivity and specificity of the widely used questionnaire-based research tools, while spirometry, which is the gold standard diagnostic test, is a challenge to use in community-based epidemiological surveys. 

Informed by a scoping review of existing questionnaires and protocols used in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) to identify CRDs, we conducted a pilot survey to explore feasibility of using screening process in four countries (Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, and Pakistan). Our pilot findings will inform a future fully powered survey to determine the prevalence of asthma, COPD and other CRD in the community, using robust random sampling strategies, and quality assured spirometry undertaken by field workers.

conceptual framework for an integrated assessment of human and ecosystem health, which facilitates
an understanding and prediction of complex human-environment and ecosystem interactions.

This project aims to assess the feasibility of using the eDPSEEA model in predicting the shedding of
paper mulberry pollen which may cause acute asthma, by collecting pollen data and correlating it with weather and other parameters; while also studying a cohort of sensitised vs non-sensitised asthma patients, and their response to pollen allergens. A modelling exercise in collaboration with German scientists, will help to devise the prediction model, to predict pollen shedding and dispersal up to 3 days prior to the event. This is important to allow patients and other stakeholders to plan for an impending peak of pollen allergy and it’s subsequent associated complications.

The outcome of this project will help to use the eDPSEEA model in other countries as well, as it is currently being used in Malaysia too.

Between 2001-2005 1.2 million women aged 50-74 years were invited from the general population and 202,638 post-menopausal were randomised (2:1:1) to routine care, or annual CA125 blood testing (7-11 rounds) or ultrasound to evaluate the impact of ovarian cancer screening on disease mortality. All participants provided a serum sample at recruitment with 50,262 providing further longitudinal annual samples (median of 9 samples). Women were free of any active malignancy at enrolment (2001-2005). During the follow-up period of >15 years to-date a proportion of those have subsequently developed a number of different diseases. Available comprehensive electronic health record linkage of the cohort's participants (including Hospital Episode Statistics (HES); ONS (Cancer registry, Death Certificates); National Cancer Intelligence Network (NCIN); and Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP) allows exploiting clinical phenotyping and diseases diagnoses made during routine healthcare in the NHS. Women were also sent postal questionnaires. Secondary studies have to date generated additional data on symptoms, menopause and its management and further details of individual cancers. 
The biobank contains >540,000 high-quality serum samples (10 x 500Î¼L aliquots in straws), composed of baseline (from >189,000 women) and a unique longitudinal set of >350,000 annual serial samples (median 9) (from approximately 50,200 women). Samples have already been validated for multi-omics analysis with academic and commercial collaborators in nested case/controls sets used for genotyping, proteomics (including SWATH technology), methylation, NMR metabolomics, autoantibody profiling, ELISA-based assays, lipidomics and miRNA.
We provide access to collection of samples and data across the following diseases: 
•	Cerebrovascular accident (disorder)
•	Dementia (disorder)
•	Fit and well
•	Heart disease (disorder)
•	Malignant neoplasm of endometrium of corpus uteri (disorder)
•	Malignant tumour of breast, Malignant tumour of colon, Malignant tumour of lung, Malignant tumour of ovary
•	Malignant tumour of pancreas
All data is stored in the IG Toolkit-compliant and ISO 27001:2013-certified UCL Data Safe Haven.

Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR) is proven to be the most effective strategy to improve shortness of breath, health status and exercise tolerance as well as reducing re-admissions and mortality in patients with recent exacerbations.

Despite this, there is no existing programme for PR being systemically introduced in rural India and anecdotal evidence points towards inadequate knowledge and practice of PR in rural areas of the Pune district.

The aim is to assess the need for PR from both a caregiver and care recipient’s perspective, while formulating and testing a PR strategy for COPD management in a rural Indian setting.

It provided policy-makers with evidence that collecting blood more frequently than current intervals can be implemented over two years without impacting on donor health, allowing better management of the supply to the NHS of units of blood with in-demand blood groups. INTERVAL was designed to deliver a multi-purpose strategy: an initial purpose related to blood donation research aiming to improve NHS Blood and Transplant’s core services and a longer-term purpose related to the creation of a comprehensive resource that will enable detailed studies of health-related questions.

Approximately 50,000 generally healthy blood donors were recruited between June 2012 and June 2014 from 25 NHS Blood Donation centres across England. Approximately equal numbers of men and women; aged from 18-80; ~93% white ancestry. All participants completed brief online questionnaires at baseline and gave blood samples for research purposes. Participants were randomised to giving blood every 8/10/12 weeks (for men) and 12/14/16 weeks (for women) over a 2-year period. ~30,000 participants returned after 2 years and completed a brief online questionnaire and gave further blood samples for research purposes. 

The baseline questionnaire includes brief lifestyle information (smoking, alcohol consumption, etc), iron-related questions (e.g., red meat consumption), self-reported height and weight, etc. The SF-36 questionnaire was completed online at baseline and 2-years, with a 6-monthly SF-12 questionnaire between baseline and 2-years.

All participants have had the Affymetrix Axiom UK Biobank genotyping array assayed and then imputed to 1000G+UK10K combined reference panel (80M variants in total). 4,000 participants have 50X whole-exome sequencing and 12,000 participants have 15X whole-genome sequencing. Whole-blood RNA sequencing has commenced in ~5,000 participants.

Definition
In addition to the main condition, the record should, whenever possible, also list separately other conditions or problems dealt with during the episode of health care. Other conditions are defined as those conditions that co-exist or develop during the episode of healthcare and affect the management of the patient. Conditions related to an earlier episode that have no bearing on the current episode should not be recorded.

For further information on co-morbidities and other conditions, please refer to the Scottish Clinical Coding Standards, (in particular Coding Guidelines 21 November 2007) as held on the Terminology Website

Points to Note

Up to five other significant conditions may be recorded for SMR01 returns.
Other conditions should be recorded according to the rules outlined in Coding Guidelines 21 November 2007.
From April 2020,this data item is no longer required for national collection on SMR00, though may still be collected locally.
Priority changed from Mandatory (where applicable) to Local.
Cross Checks

In some patients, with the appropriate pattern of emphysema, an operation called lung volume reduction surgery is effective at removing the worst affected area of lung. New techniques have been developed where emphysema can be treated using a fibre-optic camera called a bronchoscope. Trials have shown that using a bronchoscope to place endobronchial valves into the airways can be very effective in carefully selected patients and the technique is now being adopted in hospitals across the UK.

This study will collect data from people undergoing these procedures at hospitals across the UK to evaluate how well they work in practice and what factors at baseline influence response.

Baseline, three month and 12 month follow up data will be collected. This will include lung function data, measures of exercise capacity, questionnaires about health status and CT scan results.

Questions addressed will include:

(1) What lung function improvement is seen in clinical practice?

(2) What factors determine who is most likely to respond?

(3) How safe are the procedures and what is the rate of complications?

(4) What proportion of people undergoing bronchoscopic procedures require repeat procedures or surgery subsequently?

(5) Does long term survival differ between people undergoing the different treatments?

The study is supported by The British Lung Foundation and sponsored by Imperial College, London.

Dataset contains follow-up responses at one-, three- and six-months post intervention. 

Supported self-management has been shown to reduce asthma-related morbidity and mortality in high-income countries, but poor health literacy (especially in low- and middle-income countries) is a potential barrier to its effectiveness. This study aims to assess the feasibility of delivering supported self-management incorporating an adapted pictorial asthma action plan for adult patients with asthma attending a public primary care clinic in Malaysia. This study will proceed in two phases: 1) adaptation of the pictorial asthma action plan (AAP); and 2) a feasibility study including  feasibility of assessing costs. Following the adaptation of the AAP, we assess the feasibility of using the AAP to support self-management in adults with asthma. In a pre-post study, 70 patients aged 18 years and above with physician-diagnosed asthma and currently prescribed inhaled corticosteroids will be recruited. Our proposed primary outcome is asthma control (Global Initiative for Asthma symptom control). A pre-piloted questionnaire will be used to collect baseline data on socio-demography, healthcare utilisation and expenditure, health literacy, clinical parameters (body mass index; peak expiratory flow rate).

Asthma and allergic diseases (food allergies, rhinitis, eczema) are the most common chronic diseases in childhood and adolescence. They usually start before school-age and are responsible for a heavy burden of ill health, including premature death. In response, we propose an innovative scientific research program which embraces a truly trans-disciplinary team science approach, and is of fundamental relevance both to biomedical research and to evidence-based health science more broadly. UNICORN builds directly on the substantive prior investments in both the science and infrastructure underpinning research in this domain.

Pneumonia is a leading cause of childhood mortality, accounting for 16% of under-five deaths globally – with the majority occurring in low- and middle-income countries.

For the management of common childhood illnesses, including pneumonia, in low-resource settings, adoption of Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) is globally recommended. IMCI classifications depend on the clinical assessment skills of service providers and this subjectivity might lead to misclassification and inappropriate referral/treatment.

Hypoxemia (low levels of oxygen in the blood) is one of the strongest predictors of pneumonia mortality. Hypoxemia can be measured simply and effectively using pulse oximetry (PO).

The latest IMCI guidelines, from the World Health Organization (WHO), include the use of PO to classify severity of pneumonia in children and manage accordingly. Current IMCI practices in Pune district do not include PO in the treatment algorithms.

The aim of the project is to assess the feasibility of introducing PO in the IMCI programme in Pune and explore barriers to and facilitators of effective implementation with assessment of the readiness of the public health system.

Dataset contains follow-up responses at one-, three- and six-months post intervention. 

Supported self-management has been shown to reduce asthma-related morbidity and mortality in high-income countries, but poor health literacy (especially in low- and middle-income countries) is a potential barrier to its effectiveness. This study aims to assess the feasibility of delivering supported self-management incorporating an adapted pictorial asthma action plan for adult patients with asthma attending a public primary care clinic in Malaysia. This study will proceed in two phases: 1) adaptation of the pictorial asthma action plan (AAP); and 2) a feasibility study including  feasibility of assessing costs. Following the adaptation of the AAP, we assess the feasibility of using the AAP to support self-management in adults with asthma. In a pre-post study, 70 patients aged 18 years and above with physician-diagnosed asthma and currently prescribed inhaled corticosteroids will be recruited. Our proposed primary outcome is asthma control (Global Initiative for Asthma symptom control). A pre-piloted questionnaire will be used to collect baseline data on socio-demography, healthcare utilisation and expenditure, health literacy, clinical parameters (body mass index; peak expiratory flow rate).  Follow-up will be at 1, 3, and 6 months. 

The protocol was approved by the Medical Research Ethics Committee, Ministry of Health Malaysia and registered with National Medical Research Registry (NMRR-18-2683-43494).

Even where places are equipped with facilities, the availability of trained health care providers is a challenge.

Recent advances in technology have enabled clinicians to deploy telemedicine in remote locations. Telehealthcare provides a holistic approach to health and wellbeing by improving access. However, multiple barriers still exist to implement telehealthcare and to scale-up the available technology.

Use of telehealthcare for the management of Chronic Respiratory Disorders (CRDs) in India is not yet proven, hence a feasibility study will help to explore barriers and facilitators to the successful implementation of teleconsultation. This could be done by documenting views, opinions and experiences of opinion leaders and by understanding the perception of the stakeholders, including providers and patients, towards doctor-to-doctor teleconsultation.

This study will generate evidence for creating a policy on ‘Management of overall chronic diseases at remote rural area in India using teleconsultation’.
